yes , good day mean , my gentlemen .
thank you for the subject line here today , to talk .
and i have to me now imagine .
my name is beigeordneter and i am , then realized , kromberg in the city of food .
that are called wahlbeamte for eight years .
and my aufgabenbereich is : one personal computing , the organization , the public policy .
so i 'm for the knöllchen this city in charge .
and so you do n't quite popular .
i know .
and beyond , and that 's something what my son , particularly liked it , i also feuerwehrdezernent .
that means that i 'm the head of the essener fire .
ehrenamtler berufsfeuerwehrleute and siebenhundertfünfzig .
and , you 've figured i thought , and it 's a subject matter , with the i want you today konrontieren to .
which is associated with the subject of the board , because this is also heard the firemen .
we hope for the best and for us on the worst , and that has jack that once said .
you 've seen him .
he was once in general electrics .
and then i start something , we do so serious obligation to say .
i erkäre you a position .
so we talk , if it , having a risk there was that we , just a disaster , for example essener that , rush hour .
many people are the way .
it can be , it staut .
and somewhere on the edge is a suitcase , lonely , leaving , something abgenutzt , maybe on with that .
nobody seems to belong .
the suitcase heard any subject .
suddenly an announcement .
leave you that bahnhofsgelände .
police comes , fire department , blaulicht .
people scream out .
officials with .
go out there .
what 's because this ? , asking chain .
we realize that we also not or we ca n't it 's say .
the people leave the building .
children cry .
some might even , because it all very quickly go to .
suddenly a piece .
there 's giftgas inside .
a panic at random .
i am now here on .
the rest is i their imagination .
but it 's no fantasy that i just listed . fantasiegebilde ?
this is this ago in this week is happening in it .
there 's such a suitcase full of them .
afterwards she turned out , that there were just , in anführungsstrichen , nine thousand pounds of drug at it .
but the people were just like that , and that has a friend told me that tells , from the building forced them .
it was n't told .
and it came that same kind of a sudden , at least in the group on that my friend in the my friend , found myself .
god . thank is n't panic that have , otherwise would be the whole thing that we are not so benign image out how it seems .
you see , in a crisis , in encroaching disaster is it as a very important good .
communication is important , because the people in this situation , literally after telling it dürste .
they want to know what 's because it .
earlier in the good , old was time that for the authorities say , and pretty simple .
we 've just ca n't told or we 've got lied .
why ?
because area called the panikmythos there .
you , there has to feel justified to say , god , the people get in panic , there 's say we would n't like the truth or we tell untruths .
this is in a time the social media , in a time from twitter , in a time from facebook , in a time of private and public 's , in a time of equity and public television , is not possible .
just come and , because it is not be morally is and secondly , are , we are the last as a state agency , the word of this report .
remember the may still going to the car in the hudson river , while it 's a year ago .
the first are about it came at twitter .
of someone who , on a she was and just come and you immediately did , here 's a flight -- and we save the people now .
that was n't behördenkommunikation .
you see , we 're dependent on , today is and some of a the truth to say , making modifications to inform .
because of course we also the last , the supposedly swinging the truth will know , because we as why do n't need to course that either pay attention , that we just gesicherte information on .
that are public media , or , private media either ca n't pay so in touch or they do it also not .
therefore , we will be in food , and that 's also something that us , through the media has gone are , we think about how we in the future with katastrophenkommunikation deal .
and to do we will be the good old raid , scream out .
but just as a form of the erstkommunikation .
that means that we 're in the next few years about a hundred raid villages in the katastrophenfall build that , in some of you know that still , losheulen , if it 's room , for stadtgebiet comes .
it used it was so .
you may be you know , what 's three in short , even mention briefly , even taller , and once a cartoon means .
i know it 's not anymore .
we 're going to that today that with all telefonzentralen that we , at this have , so selbstversändlich , over , facebook page of twitter , about the radio multimedial also at night , about the television and after all over the internet and the local media and so forth and immediately , connected course , with kommunikationsmöglichkeiten to compete after all the information on going to get .
and we know , we need to go there 's very quickly and some kind and we need to go there 's very quickly and this out , because the zones , and citizens will be otherwise frightened .
and we ultimately , is not that we believe , what we say want .
communication in the crisis , or in the disaster is so on a question of thing about all media , the available to us , and it 's also a question of its credibility .
it 's our biggest problem , because the zones , and citizens would say , either , oh , that 's time again , you will not , or they say , the belügen us , it 's all very much worse than it in reality is .
we 've also good things i 've done with facebook and twitter , still so long ago .
also that you may have some of in them the media coverage from .
we have a bigger kray in food bombenfund of out .
and it 's called a chemical bomb .
that are bombs that deal with a auflöste has these are , because the only once did n't do the first impact on the säureflüssigkeiten explode , but through the houses in war ii , flüssigkeiten and just at the ground , because of a chemical response that was going to a little metal plate , the most durchrutschen two hausdach of each other so that the langzeitzünder , and then it on the explosion .
this problem is just , many of the suitcase bombs 've never works and lower , in kray , among other in food stadtgebiet .
and there were we go from one elderly gentleman , the extent , he , so beautiful in the report was said , to wanted , we now , he had seen as you zweitausendunddreizehn it 's and now neunzehnhundert , he has the authority over this is that there are a bomb . in the background
incidentally , since then have to acquire multiple older , are reported in the whole stadtgebiet .
we 'll see , what we still find everything .
these suitcase bombs to immediately shifts of place , not so be , but for unlocking .
and so then we have in krayer park '' and , one , in every sense of the word , a bomb on earth .
and the first time in history of the city , the whole communicate via facebook and twitter , let with the consequence that the entire follower far over sechzigtausend sprengung total followed these are .
and the media were excited . in the background .
we had to do n't even with any of telephony , but the have facebok and mitgeschrieben , everything about mitgelesen and twitter .
the whole had a great effect for us , because the it will have increased about these social media .
just so , they have to me also a sign that there , if i quit .
i can go from here , did not the watch out .
this is the credibility that as well , because first of these social media for the advantage we have that you , very much information on .
not so very informationsinteresse are , because the members of the there are or the follower , how to calls them , a high meinungsmache have .
secondly , it .
if anything not true , you write something that anyone responded immediately , so that the credibility , of the i 've spoken , really can go up , because i just the entire community in principle , the reports that there is .
and it 's a very high korrekturgeschwindigkeit therefore , so if anything that 's wrong , then it can also very quickly can be .
and we have a huge verbreitungsmenge .
i said yes , krayer , the that i found , like a bomb in sechzigteusend park up goes .
so we 've come from all the things that in the last years happened are , and it are much more unglücke happens as a lot of a still think , as a lot of a third .
also the city of food can every day of such a disaster in search for unlocking .
a bomb , the in fact to be in a park , is certainly not that sort of .
but they can also , and also after -- we now , in aufzusprüren be found and then there 's where we with our teelöffeln and try and the in seven meters deep nachbargarten .
and if the , you think , and , you think , other cities , if the then up to cure , because it 's called a säurezünder has the , you have conventional or not going to defuse that you can then we know already now , be a variety of houses , i mean , is not so look like before .
and that to communicate is important , one hand , because it 's room in a in a world which kommunikativer velocity is necessary , communication to run , to leave you also to panic , to worry about to carry that the people of these are required to worry about to carry that the people in the are able at this , these difficult situation to .
and the social media to help us as well , , to be , because ultimately you all the communications are involved , and it 's not just a one-page neuzigerjahren is how we play in the achtzieger- , siebziger- and certainly , here in the behördenkommunikation to the large part of conviction .
so now is now not just a task of the authorities , not just a task of the fire or the johanniter , the thw , the hilforganisationen , red cross , etc. , but about communication in the catastrophe and with a catastrophe about us all .
and magdeburg this has shown .
there 's about twitter and over facebook a lot of the aid has gone , if we also partially destroys you still so overwhelmed with that was because suddenly sandsäcke of people started building wanted and you know what does n't even more where the busladungen are .
this is also , there is still much to do , also for the public in communications krisenkommunikation , but the unprecedented amount of solidarity with the magdeburgern and the region has just demonstrated that the social media from a katastrophenfall , from a communication n't even more way to think are .
and i 'm hoping that i want you a little bit of 've convinced that this media , that yes , for the beautiful things of life often is used , also in krisensituationen its purpose and it and that we as a city , for the flight , as in charge is , this instrument came in the future of that , it , and very differently as well be able to her , to the citizens to deploy the zones , and citizens and so the end i now , and thank me very much for your attention , even if i want you have the entire time 've seen .
thank you .
so , a beautiful good evening .
i 'm sharlene different .
i 'm a writer and regisseurin , as you just have heard .
and i am right now , here , a own produktionsfirma to reasons .
what it is that there i produzien- 'm going , that i do you also in a moment ago .
before i do that , i must but a few things voranschicken .
the first is , , i believe that we stories really to life .
that we have no stories do n't could live .
and i believe that it 's very much more sehenswerte , hörenswerte , lesenswerte there are stories , as of the entertainment business actually be produced .
then i believe that the internet , the infinite possibility is , of fact that well as anybody bespielt really neat narrativ will .
and four days after i felsenfest convinced of that people were created , to be creative .
and that they are happier , once you will be creative to .
the more people are happy , the better about it 's the world .
so very obvious .
these better world is now , just a byproduct .
in the first line , i am , i said , a storyteller .
and the story that i do that leads to , starting to midnight poised in a what was doing , just happy birthday it will .
this is alea .
and it 's einundzwanzigster aleas birthday .
now get them from the question and the singing , not all that much as well , because in the moment , for it strikes midnight tonight is , something happens with her .
it 's something happens in your mind , in your body , with their perception .
and she did n't really words for this .
they do n't know , what 's just happened .
i have the words for this .
i call that the wizard of oz-effekt .
you see , on the side cansas and i mean ? in dorothee and everything is pretty stark white television .
i feel that i am somehow verrauscht .
'tschuldigung .
and on the other side , we have the two then in in oz with very much color .
and it was in this spot once told that i 'd better inszeniere and write , when that i draw .
so , the first , what rotem now with their new perceptions see , is a stranger , man with flammend alea hair , the ago , you very seriously at and says , congratulations , your life is over .
this is mikecz .
and alea it mikecz about it on it to go to a very special kind of people heard .
it was as spielerin born .
players are people , the your einundzwanzigsten have to her lifetime to be .
which of you know highlander ?
very beautiful .
you imagine , to be the line in it spielgeräte not a , if you go together meeting , but zögen from the pocket .
so small cube , mikadostäbchen , spielkarten , anything possible .
what really important is , the players have no insight on their time .
we know , yes , not , whenever we die .
i wish is a long life but we know what it 's just not .
it can also tomorrow 's all already be .
and power is it in my players , so .
you know how do n't want to evaluate how they because actually can play .
that means , again , every lost minute that of the last been to be .
a player , the his entire lifetime ? has , ausgeblasen in the moment of verlierens like a candle that verlöscht will .
now , this can course to ask , if that because this is dangerous , why games that then all ?
the answer is very clear : that .
without play , without any players to join a around , cansas , everything is gray and only if a player , he 's actually alive .
the were to play born .
so .
this story of mikecz and how they now the world of the players kennelernt , your first major challenges and of course , you in alea love , is the story that i that leads to .
and it changes in form of a webserie .
the first , and has 12 , sorry , i 'm here is a zahlendreher happens , who i just too late to 've seen .
so , 12 , in the first and with a total length of each spent five to seven minutes .
this type of unidirektional , a consequence of the other , storytellings told me that you know about .
that television , that has been around his geburtstunde nothing else .
that 's not new .
and if it everything would be , i now one is finished .
and also do n't actually here .
now let 's but , we 're .
we go out , to highlander back .
what 's the most famous set out of the movie or from the series ?
it can only one there , right .
thanks .
as if we practiced that have happened .
and that is what hit on my players , which is not true .
of which it can imagine it 's very many give them .
there 's so many different games .
you think to just strategiespiele , trinkspiele , kartenspiele , brettspiele and so forth and so on .
and so just unzählbar 's also the number of gamers .
and so here 's plenty of stories that all be told want .
now would be the next question : who is it because it all share ?
i 've been a fairly huge amount of opinion of me .
i think give me for sufficient intelligent and the creative .
but i know that a few hundred brains more than just one , even though it 's .
so it came right to the idea that you the crowd , in the creative process itself .
what would , if we evozieren not just about or allow them , but even fan-fiction ?
so if you say , we invite you very much a , the development of this story-cosmos with is .
you imagine , to be an example , in the , three and a mikadospieler on the , they 're totally class , because it for example , her grandfather of .
and they 're a big fan of hörspielen .
then you can now , with the modern technology is that does n't even more so hard to a hörspiel do .
and this store them on the dadran up , where it then right , and that 's really cool projektplattform , the really interested in the audience down this is .
that is , it 's not anywhere , but it ends up the right there , where it ends up .
that really nice thing is that we in the internet .
and the internet , you can really do anything .
so , every medium is somehow it allows .
that means you as viewers you can write , drawing , , so , whatever they do want .
and if we also now this structure look at .
this looks wie'n bit of doch'n net , right ?
so this storynetz , what in common set up going .
and i 'm really felsenfest convinced of that the internet was born , to have exactly this kind of stories to tell .
it just doing , still not so many , or no one .
so , now . ' i but even still a step further and in the audience was have to the players are .
which is in a smartphone-spiel .
because you can become characters from onscreen , ours , came up against people in the real environment , the number as these spiele-app on your phone .
phrases , this , the you know about this point is also all very good , are something like the mobile based and location gaming entertainment .
this wonderful to diversify into the workforce , just very rapidly developing .
and on the i do n't you can , because i used to eight minutes would need .
we go together .
everybody 's time it 's made of three parts .
the first part is the smartphone-spiel , the second part is the user-generated-content and then we do this webserie .
with this duisburg i could of the jury of the , right now , i have to that a little fact : the gründungsinitiative innovation projektplan convince them .
the have to me to get the price for the aid was given .
and i have to say , this is was all of that of licit banks , of the wirtschaftsförderungen , ihk and so forth .
so for people , you should my .
and when i the convince anybody can , here with my : the world really use , narrative structures made , the way still better world , then i believe , i can actually to convince them .
so .
everybody 's time , why is called the whole , then , so ?
because it alone in this names all areas were stressed .
we have of course in the first spielbereich : who is it , i 'm on it , you 're on it , everybody 's time on this .
of course , then that die .
, onscreen , will be very much died .
everybody 's time , which means everybody must die .
and then , they also , everybody 's time in terms of everyone can be part , when he wants to .
this is me totally important .
i come from the mitmach-theater and there 's nothing worse , i think , as if it 's a theaterbereich will .
i do n't know , whether they 've seen that .
if you in theater and then it 's the actor so in the auditorium and all this : oh god , please do n't let me .
and that 's what it 's not .
so it 's volunteer interaction .
and nobody has to .
he can also just be .
the reason why i german , speaking is the that the entire project , who will be , why do n't .
that has also a few reasons .
i 'm with this project schon'ne while the and i was always wondered : go at the question but in english , they 're the larger , blah blah blah .
and make you can i just say , the german büchermarkt is the third of the world .
the erstgrößte is the english , then it 's the spanish , and then the german .
it 's now n't so , when we would allow us in any little by moving .
and i really believe that really , if it also other people like that goes like me that the people will be grateful for something that 's not by any glattgebügelt sprachwitz was , where the bottom and then everybody durchgedreht and every pun synchronisationsmühlen been is .
if that everything that 's , it as i love to have , then goes into the first , now on the first , zweitausenddreizehn online .
and if you say , ask , why i because now here am in a spreading , where it 's put under the headline ideas worth tedx-event runs .
so i 've also a couple of the time .
i love ted-talks .
not just ted-talks .
i 'm also quite heavily dependent on of selbsthilfe-literatur and erfolgsratgebern .
a few businessplanratgeber were also , and businessratgeber .
and i can really just say that this whole know incredibly important is and an inspiring .
but it 's using all that 's nothing , if you ca n't apply them .
and my project is simply so'n thing where i just all taken , what i 've learned .
and it applied .
and so far it 's good .
i can really just say .
so , if anybody thinking , i want to do have already my bit contribute , i had degrees ' one idea oder'n character or i have a drawing für'n cartoon or , whatever , that 's also have already now .
you find us already in the internet .
on facebook .
well , like the speakers about them .
yes , because i also .
welcome to : you can memories , be ?
question , to you
you can memories , be ?
can you because it all remember , what in your life ever happen is ?
they 've still nie'was forget about ?
who has who can , all remember that ?
it go to do n't handshake , right .
so you can memories , be ?
apparently , eh .
thank you .
no , just like that we want us today is n't do .
then would be the talk to get some pretty quickly .
good evening , my name is samuel brodbeck .
the lecture on tonight is the , so i 've chosen , because he two of my passions , or my two great love down at connecting .
i picked up here in the right around the computer science studied and me just with the bits and with sticks with , the right now in size it through the world .
and seit'ner certain time i 'm also now as a coach , and its consultants , in private and professional capacity in his way .
on the one side , then i so , the living with the computer very much too busy , on the other side , i 'm currently in the in the human bisschen'rumzuforschen so'n komponten , so what works because that that the human ?
how you can because that change ?
the to join a comparison with these two .
i was recently in a very interesting discussion of artificial intelligence , artificial on .
so , the question was : when we can , when , whenever we can build a computer , the way that works like the human brain ?
so , and i think there we are already quite close .
so i think so , two hundred years , no longer need that 's not anymore .
but let me tell you do , why you that 's why that maybe noch'n some recovery needs .
so the comparison is between the computer , on the side and our brain on the other side .
if we the computer taking , then based on everything , so your smart phone , their tablets , her so'ner and also these cameras and all of all i know anywhere on desktop-pc little chip .
he 's called , cpu , central processing unit .
those parts are all of one transistor .
the word has already heard and in schaltquellen will , it as a triangle is .
that ist'n little device , that has three to and forth , current through or not .
in our computer in our cpu , we have . i got an extra nachgeguckt ago about five hundred million of little parts .
and the gears on there you could n't mess .
we can store things , we we calculate molecular stuff , we had degrees ' you with albert einstein 's say , yes , actually computers can all can be very much , very quickly , but actually he can just zero and one compare .
more he ca n't .
he 's actually quite `` the way .
we want to compare with our brains .
our brain has as the smallest unit of the neuron , the neuron , and we have this , you also there was i nachgesaut , a hundred billion , so a hundred billion neurons are in our of gray up here in .
this beautiful but is , our our neurons have not only three , but the have to zwanzigtausend per neuron .
and that makes a verbindungszahl insgesamte of , just because , is about 10 trillion .
that are 10 with 14 zeroes tush .
so , because you see the complexity of the brain is a higher than that , now what we still as a computer .
we want to the geheizt time for contrast , maybe the a or other possibilities about the , the first thing that had their own power station on , ha the which , and with the for the schaltschränke was the campus , there leistungsverbrauch .
our birne it sometimes it 's , but the box up here it takes about 20 watts .
and the is and this is the equivalent of two acres of bananas , which you do n't and she 's showing up there 's wonderful .
if we now uns'rumtragen really good part up here , so'n giant computer with so'n , why we use the then not why , forget we then things ?
maybe has been called the one or another these in the internet , so , the person , uses only 10 percent of his brain , and buy it now this mega out to dvd-set seen .
and ich'glaub there are the commercials have a bit .
ten percent , perhaps , but our brain is yes , in our evolution to this mass on , that was darumherum smaller , major in the middle there 's still our reptiliengehirn with all inside , everything else has auch'mal educated .
that 's not to happen because we do n't that we use .
why it seems then the case that we the major part of unbenutzt let me ?
maybe you know , after the term of the unconscious ?
the i compared the age , and so beautiful with the iceberg , if you the iceberg see , in sea , then it up so the top , then there 's the ocean , bottom of it 's a riesenbrocken .
and these 10 percent up , that are that 's about that , what our sense , our job mind is , which is going , but out of those , where he 's a giant unterbewusstes , too .
we 're the statement very 're 're 're 're slow hatten'grad creative .
and to fotografischem on this memory back , maybe has been called the one or other people with auch'mal memory .
people , the sudden , much more detail can remember when i do n't seen in the situation ne , and the tell and then plötzlich'was , i said yes , but yes , but , where you know that ?
that goes , there 's very , there 's a particular , called a fotografisches , so someone with brilliert , somebody the most of a field , inselbegabung , the excellent treatment is , who has a so good savant memory , who will was in a plane , so , in a plane , in a helicopter , so fast is he then be not , over rome flew , has , rome in it 's true , so rome is yes ! ow not necessarily the city , birds . after a big sign of the and has started , rome to draw .
and it 's not somehow , so here that flow , and there is that , no , every home , every single door , and every window has he once seen , he has abgespeichert , he could be back to paper .
how do is approaching now that ?
so why can the that , why we ca n't that , well , that he thought might be very close that the mensch'n bit more access to his out of those are .
now we use the yes , but why i can now not going to the going to the menükarte last night remember , in all the details ?
now an hypnotiseur of me has to an interesting things i 've done .
he has even the example , you 've been working and has with a rape , worked on the had her experience is completely eliminated , that was n't even more mind , that schutzfunktion war'ne by the brain , that 's not happening , that 's way .
wonderful , so we came the very well , right .
now went but obviously , is the people dingfest to make .
there has it in a very safe session , the end or after this event we can , as well , when you do n't even more active remember this could , could they then the hallmark of the cars , for these people davonfuhren , that was not there , that stood by its feet on .
and actually is with this hallmark of the big on doing it was breastfeeding .
the second what i was very nice to me was , he has a lady in things hit on that has told that her mother always embarrass her alice in wonderland it has when you look at it was , so four years .
there was sitting on the one lap your mother , and her mother has been reading .
and then he has her words , in trance , one time ago .
then she have begun to read , it was four than that happens is , they could then , not reading , today can look at this .
and then you have this has said he said , tell me the seitenzahl .
they actually have a specimen from alice in wonderland , they found , where that on this side of the text in the , the lady you .
the brain has so this page as it was abgespeichert , as a picture .
after that could you read .
so yes , we 've actually retained access to that , but we seem there in the normal life , we say überlasten of schutzfunktion to have to us not to so'ne .
, now , we 're not that event itself , but how schon'n have said , he has a a a picture seen , a , a a reinbeißen , we can store in our sense data , so that , what we see , this , what we 'd smell , that , what we hear that , what we taste and that , what we feel , hey , if you 're now herzhaft a yellow 're thinking and how it 's right alle'mal buchseite , they have wir'grad impression , like the taste , similarly , an example .
and , it was now füße'n long last night , put them , you alle'mal comfortable down , ha , schon'n bit above and , then i ask you , and yet , they just a very quickly affects your eyes .
and remember , they 're a very good , positive event in the recent past , yes .
they take the first , what comes .
and , if you that now make , will give you might notice that you to this memory of a visual part .
they get maybe a picture , maybe as a movie ?
some that falls that does n't just dawning on , because we the water that they do , but they do this the first time aware .
and if you see that , then it be that you , either in the film , from their eyes , all experience , or like , you see on a canvas .
this one that we call dissoziativ , the other assoziativ .
thank you , they have to the final thought back to solve , to the eyes peering back up .
who has , because a visual information , hand up ?
yeah , go gehn a few hands up , that 's so , rock 'n third kind of what i would say , yes , that 's about that , what i expected , it 's it 's actually something that we so often do that it requires us in the first moment , does n't make .
well , just do 'ma on .
hatten'grad what is , memories , if you memories entsprechendes , yes , not only that memory , sondern'n hochholen sense to think that we wes a positive that event and i was the one or another smiling can see , there was so yes , that was beautiful , there was , yes , they laugh , and already is the memory , maybe there , in fact , we do with our memories are also very nice or other feelings .
and now here 's what 's exciting .
'des everything that was my , well , the our brain power in college , no difference between what we actually reminded of have and the , what we just imagine , what we could color .
also that you can try out , , when you to home einfach'mal down and something in the future to discuss that still not happening is , they are similar information and you would like something , if you will go , something remember , what in the past was .
and , , you know yet these stories that this technology , that tells in social situation round , of the day .
then , hey , there is that happens and that , and that was so beautiful , and the longer these stories behind it , the beautiful bears are mostly the stories , hey , there were the people still a lot of drunks , there was the evening , a lot social situation , there was the sunset , a lot more romantic , there was the waterfall is still much higher .
that if we already in what do , so if we really our memories so changing , why do we do that does n't take action , i ask them ?
ich'hab , when i came down here , has my uncle is a picture , showed of his hut in switzerland .
a very nice image , it 's also a very beautiful shack .
just , the image is noch'n bit more than the shack , so it 's artistic depiction of freedom , he has been told me explain , well there is the shack noch'n bit around , there is nothin ' roll little bit more before , there 's a beautiful dog that there in the sun , on the alps , this is quite a picture of the shack , do n't need to raise .
and why do we do that 's not with our own thoughts , our own external memories , hey , what bothers me the because , i noticed that still more fun doing , what i think ?
they 've actually , make a freedom and in their own thoughts .
villeicht you know , so some people that they do you see the morning , if you just so this can have eyes , what 's because this ?
yes i whistled badly made , i went around the nacht'was through the head .
really all the night and this idea of made me , is not going .
i think it 's the the he made the idea not going .
the son war'n friend of me von'nem little depressed , when he argues , germany , because his mother in hong kong was left and he has just want you missed .
what the father has done , so he has every night with the son would and has said , or has been asking , so , what was that most beautiful , what 's happening today ?
what was that most beautiful , the time , and then he has been tied to tell , has led him ausschmücken , has just tell , what today 's happened .
and , within two weeks went to the son 're doing fine .
and then it was also okay , that the that way is that comes back to visit .
and the is this the has that all the youth being done with the answers , today is one of the positivsten people that i know .
it so these are not the memories , the us , in the , how we are , but it 's our focus on it , our focus on what kind of thought we use .
and how much energy we call to stop wasting or use .
so if you heut des'is thoughts sie'grad or say , , that was today now be , that 's so , ne square that practice , i but really does n't , they make it 's it , let 's like , you know how might tom cruise in this und'drauf'rumarbeitet fiction film , he has this , that these herzieht computer , where he shares his files holografischen sience , you make that but also time , they look for her image that hängenbleiben have of this , well , we do so you have , you say , yes , well , an'nem now abends'mal happened , but , and , away with it .
what ham , we because heut still , ah , this is , yes a time , da oah , yes , that has to me heut really enjoy , man , that was that was beautiful , all right ?
and then they take the time with .
they take that with in her unterbewusstes and let them that go work .
or if they call doch'mal'drüber in fact , actually ne , it may be 'tschuldigung their your boss , or your wife , or her husband , jezt , they laugh weisungsbefugter .
so , they also here the image , put them demjenigen'n funny hat on , hey .
bommeln gauklerkappe so'ne with so'ne , let them in the horses jump , yes , they laugh , why they laugh ?
because they sich's'grad imagine , because these thoughts are funny .
and they can be much better with the situation , suddenly deal .
ca : man memories so , be ?
no , i think our brain has been so much greater capacity that it all that can be .
but nothing , because we can choose , how we the focus and how important we make an event , a memory , one of them , it depends on us .
my plea for you have , you , they play with the images in your mind , they use the power of your element , and they give him every day suggestionen that pummel their lives , enrich themselves .
yes good afternoon .
thank you for the invitation .
if i went on a party ever asked me , what i so in my spare time doing and tell that i together with friends a schlammschlachten get organized and so , then i see is shining eyes and in the mind my audience around the connotation of those dancing crowds , zeltstädten , dixi-klos and musikfestival come up .
if i then holzvertäfelten that it in the humanities festival , `` this for classical music session is , then we say , when these are different pictures of old people , who just , long sitzreihen in ergänze sit and very focused on the art , while listening .
frank zappa once said , about music to talk is so how about architecture to dance .
and so close to behave that with the what we do .
so you yet a glimpse of getting what i 'll speak , i showed you a short film with them .
a film .
there is something in about it .
this brings it , from my the action on the point .
since unbedingten grows that podiumfestival from the zweitausendneun got out , something else to make .
we they are today 's relationship between and middle , end of two decades old and have very early in our youth who experienced , which an enormous power and delight us that classical music for .
we have but also seen that the conventions of the klassikmarktes and the kulturbetriebs us some of joy , well , a little it can .
and we are the about something that belief that 's called the crisis the classical music , did not the content , so , had the music , even though , but at their darstellungsform survival .
so we think about the question , how we can a konzerterlebnis create that the music the near , the friends and that power back that there is so that we pay so , you 'd like .
how we can a kulturbetriebs organizing , that infects the conventions of the klassikfestival work ?
we imagine the parameter that you go out of the concert will know , space , time , light , context , basically in question .
we take for example , in the relationship between people and musicians .
normally , there 's between the stage and the to a gulf .
we 're trying to the end up .
here you a picture of our jam-konzerten .
the musician is sitting in the audience , drink beer , entertain , 325 breaks down with the audience , standing on , play a , two pieces , sit back in the audience .
the whole thing is the course at a little lockerer .
everybody who , like it has mitzuspielen , comes on the stage and goes back .
or that 's sitting in the concert .
in the concert does it 's so that you go on more or less comfortable , integral to chairs , like you here , and to jump forward at and listening .
but there 's music , because you ca n't actually sit still .
and we 've thought , and how can this implement .
if you differently sit and to a mitbewegen piece of music rhythmischen can , hear them automatically lead differently .
still socialized to come , that we had transpired in the concert does n't a stage , but four stages the audience around .
the audience could mean time , mitdrehen .
so she sat down 82 percent , evening everybody in the front row .
important for us is that we 're not only just any events are doing , but that we of the music from thinking .
that we 're so questions that spaces and the atmospheres around , but also in the mind of the people need the music that you , so can see how they do ?
and so then performing at night to weinkellern clock only 30 in industriebrachen , the s 's actually just from kerzenlicht enlighten , in clubs , on kirchengebäuden , in old zweiundzwanzig .
but not just the spaces around , and the illumination can music to become alive and now , but also the connection with other arts .
and so we are totally happy , that we 've been a few years with the kammermusik working together , the with us ; or movement to music to bundesjugendballet that not actually the dance . been written is .
and so then kammermusikstücke for streichquartette of beethoven , or for choreographien from steve get rich .
and this year , we 've gone a , yes that if you want , kindheitstraum it fulfills .
we have the first time a concert together with a animationsfilm-team implemented .
we have the story of soldiers of gesamtkunstwerk animationsfilm with actors , dancers , live-musik and just strawinsky to a igor theory together .
that has all , as well , for that works , because we have a big internet-community had , the us in this piece supported by .
we have about a crowd-funding-kampagne much money from people from germany to , so that we that 's been able to .
at all is this film festival something that one of a community turned out of structure .
we 're totally happy in the near of esslingen in the town stuttgart a home , and i have them .
the city is that of this is how big that we have well-protected spaces and exciting place for performing at finding , but also so small , that we 'll notice .
if beginning of the year in the spring , two weeks for instrumentenkoffern from europe , in the city are , then drops on just that in the city more people with spitzenmusiker so when she normally .
that all about this is , organized .
we they 're a by nature of my students and students , medical professionals , medientechnik , musik- , literaturwissenschaftler , really totally up .
and to a kernteam a formieren gesamtorganisation for that the leitungsteam or so , and funding in your eye that keeps , dreiköpfiges seven to 10 makers in a leitungsteam , the for for a year , no to take over .
it also made , but they do for a year that for example , that veranstaltungtechnik or the künstlerbetreuung , the ticketing in about something that hands are and to the humanities festival is organized .
we do that all in our time and live in germany .
that is , the worst part of the work is originating in and on a internetplattform .
just three times in the year we make us over the year to a city on weekends , we , to talk about the a or other problems that popped up , and gardening for this is also interpersonal each other , that 's important , that if you something in motion to .
this even come then two decades until thirty thousand volunteers , to think that the for a few days or a few weeks their hands of being and there is where it is that , the brötchenschmieren that , the ticketverkaufen that , the räumeeinrichten that , the stühletragen .
and of course that appear in buddhism 14 days , the musician .
now you could mean , so you would have everything else you for so this needs .
but our macherkreis about that .
we have is in esslingen in the city a large community around us built , that we can be supported in the what we want to do .
that goes from the biomarkt go , that goes but also about very practical things like an example , the of , because we have a baker , the us with bread aushilft or a sponsoring , the fresh food available to work it .
that ticketing going in a walk in the city and control over the year , and sells .
crowds to the probemöglichkeiten .
we have in esslingen a whole range of individuals that were found us their living room available to imagine , so the musicians and samples .
and on this particular way , is that this to something that in this city has become and from the people in this city .
they identify in a very special kind of and so interacting with this festival .
since the beginning of the year we could thank trägerstruktur of support the citizens rushed there , a bürgerstiftung launched in a call that now the entire endeavor in a sustainable and reliable großzügiger turns out .
we used by the stage , believe that classical music know , as they come in the right hands .
so we are incredibly deeply happy about this is that in europe , young musicians played music in their own hand , you take home , in the cities podiumfestivals this right .
, when you now , still not that can imagine , to make this feels , classical music that way to experience then they come but just over .
the next year , we 're back in esslingen and we would be delighted , if you actually , there are .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , learn .
you just think know them .
know what you need to learn or to the effect of learning , but i mean , to learn about rd2d2 , a lot more , which is also urteilskraft rungen ren collecting and erfah win .
know , with an experience lebensgestaltung , a formula for the urteilskraft .
what i made of art and culture 've learned , now , because i can get lots of course , to say because now 've owned beite i mean , in this field .
and so i thought that it may be , this is something durchzieht a different takes to give , what my talk knöchernen .
art is beautiful , but much work .
they have now , both laughed .
you get the laughter , though most of the saying you know .
why is that ?
i think that has to do with that in the word something drinsteckt , what we 're not that means we can .
art , say that we also , sometimes , that has what .
to work , we say that 's , that has what .
sometimes , too .
the people , the like to work , that has what to me .
but at work that we think more likely to the alltagswelt and in the art , rather , the realm beyond the everyday life , where we inside of us move , our experience points , , our own thoughts .
and so i 've spent my life , who i you now you want to , in about three hours in five were divided that all the headline said , have a starting to kind of it for you very simple is .
it starts with the berufsstart , for our childhood , goes on the inspiration , for my youth , i 'm not all tell from my youth , do n't worry , then go further , the word so i 'm explaining afterwards , why i found that ashamed to invention .
the interaction , for the first part of my professional life and finally , fifth , positive identification .
and one of you will these will these pieces of johann 's the stream of yet .
dreistimmige , two and inventionen .
you learn them so in the first two , three years , if you 're reasonably practice , and i 've had practiced .
and so with 10 , 11 , i 've got these little pieces and ground , on the piano , not far from here , at the kreuzeskirche , at home .
these pieces of life of a kontrapunkt .
there is a melody and the other voice korrespondiert , but it 's very differently .
the rhythm -- it 's the same , but it 's gegeneinandergesetzt .
and that , ladies and gentlemen , is something crucial speech , the art that it really succeeds , and it only two voices are , ungleichzeitig together , together to think if that the present , the future , the past 's sometimes , in about works , images , in choreographien , in with , things that gegensätzliches are , for the moment to put together , that gives art .
and i 've learned , two distinct melodies , sometimes three , once in the inventionen dreistimmigen , both being able to play , any way to know , the one illustrate that do n't .
it was the , what i 've learned , , among other .
a another experience i never forget and i was the worry about it to me today may also 's how could .
i have the beethoven-sonate , it were still more people in the hall than here today , and in the middle vorgespielt i came out .
i had forgotten .
i 've played .
so again , what it 's begun , and at the same knew i tried and not on .
this audience has more what almost as i , because i went in all quiet on my place , brought my notes , put them , and he started the third time , in front .
and they do n't think , how the me applaudiert 've got behind .
but that was a very heavy experience .
perhaps that was also one of the experiences , where i then you know , well with the piano , although i then quickly as a studentenausweis had , i should perhaps not my career go , because in talking you can be easier to cheat .
yes , the next the next chapter in my adolescence , i mean , and with the inspiration and also because i want to them tell stories .
when i then so chopin-walzer was , i went to my jure and told him , rather , klavierlehrer , i 'd like to a sechzehn play .
and he said , oliver , that does n't do .
because you have to create a lot of coffee houses to have and very much experience with women raised all have .
now you imagine , about , a sechzehnjährigen young man , so , young , such a sentence .
the i kind of course not forget .
and , but i kind of course , even more adept .
now , i was , and to time in a kaffeehaus .
i 've practiced , and i remember , a situation that i do so never more 've experienced .
it was that scherzo of which of chopin , and now i get to the part of work , i have a just not on , and it was with the most beautiful , very broad you had the poor do , and then went back together and back apart .
i can it now , not play , is not a piano here , and i could it 's not anymore .
i have these two decades , 30 times in playing and suddenly you right .
and then i put it 's coupons and weitergespielt , i was doing in a feeling ecstasy and ground , and i know , to that i suddenly on the soil and quit and laughing .
i was except me .
i had nothing to , nothing , and the music has this with me done this .
an experience , where i 've learned , emotions also really allow that .
and sometimes it 's also , this was going to work that you go in these been there , in this condition , i call it 's see , the flows .
where everything from ourselves .
we had this situation , would then in the zweitausendzehn kulturhauptstadt in an organization .
there was then almost anything like of myself , when we the abschlussveranstaltung , has the only two months took us , where you usually a half years for would need .
so , that were my unsighted experience with the piano , with the art , with this work .
and now i get to my student , one .
i was first even when musicians and the way , but i just as hobbymusiker .
we 've got into playing , klavierquartett , flötenquartett .
i 've gemeinschaftserlebnis given and i got there are so you to my jura-studium for the music to engage and that klavierunterricht of out .
in the choir sing , let 's all breathe , a h-moll-messe sing , wonderful experience , the me very , really have .
and then came a point , where i as a law student in the spd theater , in the neunzehnhundertachzig gone , in the dramaturgie and the overhead , and i did that 's why do with one of , this chapter , because there for me this incursion of it was , or that this idea came , from this combination of art , culture , i was then , grillo-theater also just in the essener have , politics and law school a profession , to do .
which is the art , culture to really , to my leitmotiv to make .
so here are working for the art , but it 's not as artists , but otherwise would you do n't say kulturarbeiter , but as kunstarbeiter 's basically , and growing to do something .
i was there in theater and i brought me kulturmanagement , there 's in germany , no interest for erkundigt , just in vienna , there , so i did , and , but i 'm going to , with this question is busy , what you can do art to to get to get the framework for art to improve , to have a good case management , a good design features of building ?
and that was , the reason why i then also still am in my professional lives , in direction of this kulturdezernent , and with fünfunddreißig years . i was then berufes .
but before that was n't take a berufsstart , and this phase i mean , and with interactions .
städtetag i came to the germans neunzehnhundertsechsundachtzig .
the german köln has its geschäftsstelle in städtetag .
i 'm ausmerzen , though sometimes in my résumé , because i in scheytt born was , always , the kölner , köln , about one , i am i have to this kind of time ruhri .
but i have a köln root , because my maternal grandparents were also kölner waschechte , and there , in rheinische , i 've experienced .
that was me before , something that i do n't like being enjoyed , and suddenly i was sucked in a different form of culture , in a städtetages , in a culture , the place history of people in this in this what 's the volkskultur .
once the on us with , were all in a very different situation , all other states .
i and then with alles-hat-ein-ende-und-nur-die-wurst-hat-zwei kölschen , the future -- and nordrhein-westfalens justizminister , the my friend and colleague who was asking , then we have always for the dieckmann tonight music , and he had guitar , i piano , still do n't take a bass -- played for example , i could then , jochen .
we have the umgedichtet städtetages done , so , but of course , these texts of the herzbuben wildecker , for months practiced .
and this , that came really from the people out .
it was my destiny , that i got to the ninth november kriegte for my doktorprüfung learned and i neunzehnhundertneunundachtzig n't begin with that the wall fell .
i woke up the next day on , i had an oral exam , oh , the wall is really like , yes .
i would quickly , it comes for , on any questions to grundgesetz .
and there was i came for the cities in the east germany .
and i 've experienced , as an interaction as a place between two germans cultures .
actually talk we the same language , the music is going to go there , wonderful and was wonderful and ground , but i was umgedeutet , umgewertet .
different than the answer was n't it from the people all within ourselves , but it was a lot of the top , and i put this as a great asset that 's , here to experience , how the german , identity -- i get after time , back , slow it 's cracked and the german einigungsvertrag then these two states in fingertips .
since is germany kulturstaat .
since is also on the federal much more kulturförderung placed .
interaction , i then , but all things here learned and experienced , in the city food .
we 've come from the first place that i had actually a dezernent , you imagine that time ago , when i here 's started , visitenkarte , stood on my neunzehnhundertdreiundneunzig visitenkarte for culture and play .
i have the still .
free time for was grugapark , you do n't want to write dezernent for culture and gruga-park .
i was looking at the first of the gruga-parks .
so i 'm having leisure can not so much so , anyway , that was wonderful , that i these visitenkarte had , but they would soon , because i then for education in charge and to make alliances -- in the education do and they could .
we have very much for the urban studies done , we have the you 're only time this in between folkwang-museum , münster and entlanglaufen see , what we designed to have the , kulturpfad experience , münster , where you interactions between art and architecture see that we can , from the volkshochschule to lichtburg , the blue stones .
many , when we could and i could actually designing and i 've experienced , and the time , what that means , if people from different parts of a goal to track .
they memorize the way that i think about , wegkomme of the art , always more on the culture , the us is that keeps us that : between humans , between cultures , between those communities , , i should in the view , and i come but afterwards on the art back .
as it was also then between the kulturhauptstadt the issue than we , ruhrgebiet , seven zweitausendeins the idea that had the uk would be , january dezernenten , that zweitausendeins could , is to the ruhrgebietsstädten europe , that .
but that last chapter , this one chapter one has yet the headline of identification .
this word has two primary meanings , one thing , , i do me with something , bekenne me so to something , and i can it but also as verb use and say , i do something that means , i know something .
and it 's always in his window .
i know something with his window , so i say , i do you or the or that community .
and i do me with something , if i want to make me bekenne and say , that you wanted to me , with the i want to identify .
and that 's a very big action been .
five billion point three million people , and trying to move , bekennen cities , to identify in that sense , to dreiundfünfzig and to realize that you a community is in europe .
as big , we have it then hundertvierzig called , but anyway , as a community of many people , the in a big dichotomy between life and yet , at least a common language to talk , even though metropole nations are here and this was our hands , the positive identification to start with the people and you some of course , too much a ride .
so in an indication , and i sperrung the highway , many other experiences .
a nice experience of the kulturhauptstadt have not so many people are .
there at has stalingrad nowgorod and eat , two schools , has worked , young girl from nischni , and from the mädchengymnasium , and young students from a half school , from borbeck nowgorod , have letters of people , young men , from nischni to a , the data , the home , and , love , death , the last letter that have written .
and it was already a special effect that young girl letters of young männnern up and young russians and then of letters of young men from germany in something that are german .
and there would set of these young men the piano , and playing these chopin-walzer , who i so loved .
and , oh , quoting from a letter and said , i 'm a pianist , he wrote him at home , as young german the , he played , and i can never more a abgefroren play , because my my two fingers on chopin-walzer are .
and he chopin-walzer his finger down with a zeche , sat back the piano in this , on mullbinde carl and tried , the umwickelte to play .
and it did n't show him .
it was for me so one on scene , that i to jump forward in am , i said , what we 've actually learn ?
we 've learned , in the kulturhauptstadt that many people together something can move , but all things we 've learned that we in years in europe in peace of living and culture of us that connects them , that we 're not more the minds go , because we different languages talk , that we have been able to identify ourselves to us i feel .
and that was for me a wonderful experience and you see , it 's about the can learn not just about , something to know .
it 's about the can learn about , something to learn and urteilskraft won .
and if we 're much for reinventing and invention to recognize , inventionen , if we tolerate that we inspire us let of art and culture , our own right position to relate , in dialogue with the artwork , if we interact and finally done , our own identity , every working , by we worry about art and culture a hospital , then we have all .
and i 'm hoping that they were many , kulturerlebnisse and kunst- have , from where they would those profit .
thank you .
yes , thank you .
i think , we wait on the first picture that matter .
so i have to hingemacht to the support my memory here 's a few slides meim .
it are but no scientific slides , but it goes in my speak here , is a direction to find and me with a theme way through , where i think that 's going to us the next few years to engage .
by the education words i know now finally , thank you , what ted 's also means , and i think , in einleitenden we can this talk about it .
and then i had heard that you the talk in english should , if somehow became possible , but , if you look at it , then you see , they would n't understand , what i in english to say , i was not directly , it as i should tell and so i have the talk , `` well , most commonly left .
how we will die .
i have to them there first of rosalinde tell .
betreue was a patient in the hospital , in i spent the röntgenabteilung rosalinde , and was to .
it was about those years old and has always like in the may to dance , because they that ends , her husband who reminded , the to the first man , the in war was then .
and so it 's of every year for the first of may be able to dance , and has long was dancing and probably even then a schenkelhals bowle to a lot to , and then is down and has lifted , here on the right-hand side you see this , the leg gets broken , the gläschen .
a few years earlier was they also gives us , down and had to say , same way , with equal occasion , us , the left leg gets broken .
and i was also have already there as a doctor and 've experienced , as you for weeks on the intensive , as you with the antibiotics that was treated , resurrects itself was , and the discussion around , how has been said , is because that sense ?
it makes sense , in a so old people like it 's going to use to put it ?
so what , to zuzumuten , on the intensive care for weeks , like this is a people at all beatmen ?
and it 's then , had been .
five years later -- i get the clinic , i see the name rosalinde , and the , can i remember , because he just so rare is , also for the time back then , and has ever danced in the may be back the other one leg gets broken .
so , the question , what vorsorgevollmachten i think it 's actually , if i talk about , like a human to decide what to say , what he in his directives , or what he ends , bespreche it ?
and that 's a little bit about the subject of the presentation .
you see here then the urvater the redwood named , how we will die .
it 's a book out of club-of-rome , how we 're going to , a report to the car neunzehnhundertsiebenundneunzig
and then it was so that the globalization , very ahead , went to go and so this technology , asking it has , how do it because go , connected to work ?
you has come , and that you can in this book today , here is , just said , it becomes a quality control , so that the parts always go together .
it becomes an idea is the work in , it will also the work , a lot stronger it will , for me to china , this was a big issue .
and that 's actually , so you have been suggesting that basically the work of the individual , so something is , something to care , one are now , that he always getting more control it was also of the quality residential suburbias that he know , of the accuracy .
and that , after my prior assessment , the people 's a lot more , confidence from their work to praise and , big part of a little wertschöpfungen , where it about , and the high räderwerkes , to try and not more about , through his work , too , to define .
and that if we now , on the pflege- and medical domain , then there 's because of course , just as an evolution .
if you in television even hear that , which doctors , nurses and also dokumentationspflichten the most well , then is it the so-called altenpfleger .
and that means nothing else , when there must have to be , what you has done , so it einklagbar is going to make it even paid will , and if not going to document is , collectively the health service 's also , these care or that medical practice pay we do n't .
and through these ones with your mind , but the work nicht-glaubwürdig-sein , feel stronger abgestraftwerden and going to , and this idea that you his work is fulfilling and with this use of personal belief and , in the background as a kontrolliertwerden , entwertet , and pflegenden .
a good friend of me is now , from holland gone , because he showed this , is not really wanted , who had a altersgebrechen surgeries , has the up , is , from holland went to hang your doctor for allgemeinärztliche seen .
the altenpflege are in fact that 's mostly a piece of forward and he , the martin , had just experienced that , big old people swing between the home , the hospital , , and go back , because the holländer , is not know , what you ought to see , if the people got worse .
then you have the the hospital , to do so , go back in my senior home , or a nursing home , and be there on .
and this family doctor , did you get smarter , if it into that they structure in holland , there , then i want to be there 'd like to let to something here in that you go out of this vicious cycle of the herausbrechen and the also behandelns menschenunwürdigen of people unglaubwürdigkeit can .
well , in holland , which had he was , these brain , after he the language with a lot of your way from -- i had learned that there , the same thing happens , what transpired in wie-wir-arbeiten-werden happened .
it will also trying to die is a quality control .
it 's not more the credibility that counts , but you put even in a freely available right , and i want an example , not be brought back , or not the hospital , i noticed in the home .
and then is that was .
in the netherlands is it so , the third days a conversation with the newly admitted , and the need to then , an issue , i want the hospital or i do n't want more the hospital , if me something happens .
so just with the , i want to be brought back or i do n't want to be brought back .
this data willingly go then , a central and there is this doctor for altersgebrechen , has always the 's going on , and then the decision in the basis .
if we now , rosalinde back , the like in the may to dance has and also to was , and us imagine that would eventually she wrote , i want to do n't be brought back , then you know , they these two , dance in may be in the may , where they then again to is , yeah , not more to experience .
and this for my friend now , the there in the netherlands is , also very much kopfzerbrechen , and it up with .
in the last it 's so that lebendigseins today about their until seventy percent of the people , is not to home to die , but in hospitals , from rating , and that this has just as well , so you can perceive , not the ideals of habitat for an old people , but it 's often a really closely überlastet that there , the pflegekräfte are often gefasster and the funding standpoint , and for this heut find my practice , perception , just constrained by instead .
there 's and homes , having the very good way to do , there 's very pflegeheimen people that there , in addition , but if i think about the zwölftausend at it , and we have about gesamtbilanz patients in the year , so this about five , six thousand shows that perhaps from enthusiastische to us , to , it would i want to me say , it is difficult , there for getting and be a sense to hold .
the entire course , pekuniäre reasons , that 's very clearly , this whole quality control , these control is that introduced , because in the last the money for it 's not enough , that all people can and in under way of those are and that the people that need to deliver or the medical performances that paid to realize that they say , there was -- i well with clear , because i can example , as caregivers a family of feed with one or two children .
this is today , just not the reality , but you need two salaries in altenpflegebereich and pflege- and mostly it to actually , just below .
this introduction of the quality control than a result of the growing rates of the market , the way to regulate , want to make , so on the individuals have to .
and now i get to talking about how to the maybe we can escape , so what do we now in the last minute , i 'm asking for himself , and this , so , it 's the situation for affected is not .
and i 've just that festmachen herausgesucht and the article , been told me there hervorgekramt , because i think , a society , which is always been so structures that , the legal structure there where , we looked at the grundgesetz , what happens in our society .
and in grundgesetz article on one is just said , the dignity of the people 's much .
and the second set up there is , you to protect is get their task of all staatsorgane .
and what i worry sometimes it 's missing , is still a third set in there is that is a lot of everyone 's also for the assignment to have , his willingness to to protect and to defend themselves .
because that a way is , singing to free from this case , i give the other way and the supposed to me time somehow , and , and feed and then i need to me at least not my thoughts about doing , as i because even die 'm going .
because in the last , it is yes , so , even though we do this subject does n't like to imagine , we will eventually , the point is coming .
hopefully , just too late , with a century or hundertzehn .
this is the size of course , my career as well , to say , that i hope for each and there . i 'll also to worry , but eventually you will be the the subject to , and if it then maybe that far is , or , just , if you fünfundneunzig , fünfundachtzig or fünfundsiebzig is , it can already late in life to be late in life be to say , i 'm thinking about this question now even think .
now if you think about , what makes my 'd like , then you will be on the results come , where then in the last to come out , what are because actually the five most important things in my life been ?
there 's now a book , what 's pretty en vogue is .
it are the self-esteem of course , it are then the friends , the and i mean , with that i 'd go and exchange can , the know me and the me through the life with me , it are the familienangehörigen .
it 's sure that trust between people , which i may also to do , in rechtsanwalt or in the actual visits in or a pastor or a pflegebereich or just inspecting other people , with that i put in israel 's note .
and it there are very many individual factors of course , there hereinspielen , i 'm taking the now , not all through .
but if you , these three penalty points , yourself , then you have already all sorts of tasks , like this technology , in life there might be in order to the past its own willingness to to protect .
and then coming then still a another factor that we kind of a dictatorship suppressing the gutmenschen experience . i got this one time so as a text , or as a wondrous as an example of this .
other people can for us these decisions and this behavior , what 's ansteht , not meet .
this is my inner conviction .
we would can only from us even come out .
so it 's not the question , what are because others to me to do , who 's going to me in fact , inadvertently feed , for babies , or for me , who goes up to me ?
but it 's exactly the other way , to be asking where i can on people , want , where i ca in and by my inner would die of that i do with these questions that can and me there position and around it can .
and then when you say , how we 're going to , so this nightmarish inner control , the us the outside of sat up , it 's an opportunity , to say , how i me about my my inner would , this mechanism to get away .
because no man can tell me it , how i find yourself because see and position to .
and i must also do n't fit in general stimmungslagen or not that might say , you have to now an advance directives out and because you 've already that old , going to you exactly , whether you can be brought to , whether you on a neonatal intensive care to .
these questions that i can see in the last only to have a long vorarbeit likely how do .
these would the people 's an inner posture , the in me and the not the outside of that can be that the state n't can protect them , even a law 's not , and that i 'm also other people zubilligen can and i 'd rather zubilligen be , if i think that there myself before faced with which is have , so that the also know , what i for a person who am .
and those conversations to lead , it requires that particular spaces , and since i think , and for that i have this talk so called , and myself , think , are these spaces like that näherzubringen in food , that i showed you here we tried , on a picture times kreuzeskirchenviertel , spaces , where we over these subjects to think , where there , or more room is , so , it does n't hurt this is that 's also may not to our theory is , but that even a conversation happening .
so we do , if we then old are , you can say , oh yeah , such a dance in the may , despite my may very high ages , that would still time .
i thank you very much for your attention .
a good evening .
i 'm bringing two things with .
if you the first part to flat is , you make a little wach..
it 's still a second .
we start with the infinite .
this is really dumb , not , can be before .
what you mean ?
there 's different unendlichkeiten ?
or is infinite enough ?
yes !
that 's not good , if this one is , what 's !
so , in the fact , but i know it , for the that you know it .
that 's exactly how we do n't .
we engage us only with a single .
and i 'd like a little to the finite planet .
ne , possibly we know , which we form of us a to know .
and it goes for the mathefreaks the sheer magnitude of vast amounts .
if we in the finite or are , and those two objektmengen , in the one example , chairs , in the other people .
we know , suppose , already now , we look in the box goes in , the number is small , it are three : chairs and it are three people .
we can we 're checking , whether in any amount of the same number of elements in it 's ?
count , how would we 're doing it ?
that means that we would just at the people durchzählen , one , two , three , we get the three , we count the chairs , see three chairs , one , two , three , three and three three is three , and wonderful .
that you mean , yeah ?
very beautiful .
this works in many wonderful , this works , too large numbers , although it sucks .
but it does .
how do you count ?
how you can still going to check it is that many people like chairs out there are ?
i 've got aware of the chairs and people , and not what else .
daraufsitzen let me !
it 's called the couples !
you very well , that this is clear , not , we 're now the ground on and understand that 's also all !
not , this is very beautiful .
so , you call this , too much advanced a paarungsfunktion and it works as well , yeah ?
you take a , you on a chair , from the mouse .
the next pärchen away , the next pärchen , everything is beforehand , different people get different chairs , not a chair back empty and the vast amounts of these are the same height , okay ?
now we go into the infinity .
how we can two large infinite amount of each giving it ?
we would say , the one is that big or bigger or smaller than the other .
we could we 're doing it ?
we would be back to start to .
alright , that 's wrong , because the point is the , if you in an infinite amount of start to count , yes , i 'd just say , they do n't come to another .
ne , infinitely , , it is much ?
so , which is how do it ?
madame ?
it , madame !
they had the men 's really started !
and there !
so , now we look at the time .
estimate . appreciate is in the infinite always bad , yeah ?
you can tell you see , no end , yeah ?
the point of this is , you make it very simple .
if i example , the zahlenstrahl take , those numbers , ne , we could need the next to the beginning , zero , one , two , three , four , five .
and we have predicted outcomes , we present , a copy of this ungeraden and take from of paper , the infinitely bandes numbers way .
it left the numbers , okay , zero , two , four , six , eight , much ?
okay ?
all along linear numbers are ungeraden on the infinite number of long , the natural numbers , but on the a band n't have the ungeraden , on the other are the straight and the aufm on it , okay ?
we call the a lot of the straight to pay , we call the other kinds of know-how out the natural numbers .
what you think ?
is powerful , it 's bigger than through n , same size or smaller ?
the same ?
but this is very now , yes , for a missing the ungeraden .
who have a different guess ?
smaller ?
who says , bigger ?
ah , the has really no plan , yeah ?
that can also not be , yeah ?
they can not , where what 's missing , bigger , that 's not actually ne square ?
okay , they say smaller ?
you would assume , not ?
this is the conventional wisdom , what to say , and it 's wrong .
and now , and now , i 'm why the vast scales in 2007 .
and how does it ?
right .
yes , we mate .
this is the point .
we mate .
we take the zero from the a lot , we take the zero from the natural lot , mate , out .
the next to the ground zero , plus two of it 's two , after the zero from the one , and i 'll get back a pärchen .
the four , the two , the six , the three , the eight , the four , yeah ?
you can it also turn back , then it 's doubling , that is clear , much ?
and that 's clear , through the sportgymnastik-band we do it 's speculated that i 'll do it always in the lecture that 's a rhythmischen paarungsbildung .
and this one , there are just the straight on it , and the band is a long , yeah ?
we ungeraden the natural on the straight , hex , the verhexen are way and that 's still , in a long .
that there 's just in the infinite .
so if you some explain what to have today we learned , have an eternity go learned , yes , what 's because forever , i know just finally ?
one of infinity has a property that there 's in many men 's not and this trait that says , is an absolute charakteristikum a true , a , the right size it 's .
that they can do in -- not , if you from three three people are two people heimschicken , it 's only still a great , and that were three .
yes , so we 've infinity .
is not about ?
okay .
then do we still a second part , probability .
the professionals , all likelihood .
here what brought .
with this experiment i 'm sure , will least a third know and wehe it does anybody with , the that it has , yeah ?
so , we call the doors , a , b , c .
i 've got behind anything or hidden , i hope that you has n't heard .
and they should now why do n't guess .
where , you mean , i have something hidden , behind a , b , or c ?
guess , here , our schätzfreund , here .
they number in the c .
who still has one another idea ?
a to ?
who still has an idea ?
i , ne , b has been missing , not , otherwise would hear the never been on , much ?
this is right .
it 's really matter , so they have to do n't mean , the three letters to fall and i 'm looking for me a .
it 's really matter , yeah ?
it 's completely clear , because that the chance that you , they 're lucky , is yes , they only one-third .
ne , there 's three things , it 's really matter , yeah ?
now i am here , i 'll just one on .
well , i know of course , where it 's up .
wehe , that has anybody here , too .
so , i know , where it 's up , and the best guess , and appreciate that or , anyway , you it 's called , goes in a second round .
so i 'm actually now the game of what i now , now , on-the-fly .
so it 's so , we go in a second round .
now , suppose , i kapriziere me on that a , much ?
so , now i have to a door to show , behind the n't it 's around and the they do n't have said .
because , if you 're now , say , and i say , and i know , it 's not b .
then there 's not a second round .
then i say , ätschi-bätschi , from the mouse , one size of out .
but i have to my , that 's econ 101 , in the second round go .
so i can just an open , behind the it 's not only is not , but what they also do n't have said .
now is the question , and this is the all likelihood , under the condition here has remained , under the condition that , b , is , and it 's not one is , they have now your last chance , trained to guess .
they must now in a to stay , then i do it 's a , on .
now , i that on , what they want to have .
or they say , i make them on .
now is the mathefrage , it 's now with this knowledge likely ?
phew , and good , b is on , now i know , it 's behind them .
or but , god . thanks to b , had been is , i always wanted to with a to stay , this is it .
or would you now say , there 's fifty-fifty , we have , the ne , away with it , we 've only two doors , now it 's no matter , the way to or to stay .
what you mean ?
it is n't matter .
fifty-fifty .
why is it does n't matter ?
very beautiful .
why it 's why is it fifty-fifty ?
yeah , right , that 's wrong .
the way it 's almost , as if we do it yesterday , which were saying , much ?
but so they are , ne , are a new no , fun .
so , this , the thing is very easy , yes .
that get all sorts between , i know not , six and , yes , i ca n't in years , otherwise you can i 'll see in , is not part , much ?
so , it `` really everybody .
behind this door is it to a third .
and it 's always just going to a third of behind a door .
they can guess , what they want , they have with two thirds of installing them in the dirt .
that means that would you can on two doors guess , not , that you can yes , in roulette do , you can go on two dozen headquarters , it 's true , ne , if you the zero , there , that there 's saying yes , everything in real life .
but here we 've just a door .
so , now is this , two thirds of it 's not , what you guess .
so what 's the two thirds of here , but it can just behind a door .
behind the onus is not .
now , which is then more likely ?
it . i got really quite hidden away !
now , which is now more likely ?
it 's better , to stay , or the way to ?
now it is simply , yeah ?
yes , of course !
so , that was now not hard , much ?
ha !
what we see ?
they 've got hit on .
why ?
very simple , two thirds are not a hundred percent : the difference between the theory and practice .
i hope , it was for everyone , what that .
thank you .
mr. dranlassen they wanted to me , jamie oliver reichert , the here is out of this is no diet and bad food and overweight people to cover , this depressed -- a completely .
but i started my best thing that after all over again way is , these experiences .
i come here is going from demeter farm and knew i got to 12 was actually ca n't a mcdonald 's .
that time to others reenter society , right .
yeah .
thank you for the invitation today .
i 'm here in the close up .
and i do n't know , whether you reichert also why it came to me to be asking whether i realized , ted talk on the lake in want and over a particular topic to talk .
i blew me rausgesucht heut : the subject of trust .
now , you motivation is also not bad and i reichert me the woman schließ , that has said , maybe it makes the a or other and more sports .
i also full of that plots .
so tonight is in the rain more going to go to be now fünfhundertvierzig too much to , but i have to this morning , actually train , because i in three weeks at the trontheim june , mittsommer , of zweiundzwanzigsten to drive to copulate with a bicycle '' -- that are bissl miles .
so i could still remains the morning , the late . n't do them .
so who have to come abendtal , go tomorrow early on , in rennradfahren , i -- they all welcome .
i 've already said , briefly , i heut sprech the issue of trust .
and i started , you , with the subject urvertrauen .
do n't worry , the nice , little boxes , the blind faith comes after noch'dran .
i 've done before me a second thoughts about it made , when i herkomm am , like this i would be the where i hergefahren ?
so , i come from village with six houses , you very hopfen , some hopfen and in my parents , on the farm there 's an apple here , apfelsaft and hopfenstöcken -- and what do you from äpfelbäumen : `` beer .
trust , in sports , of course not in apfelsaft but for me , doping and beer .
why , i the story , where i 'm from ?
for me is one of the stories that i really so right away from the country , from a town come and there was raised with two big brothers , with the oldest brother , the sehend is .
and with the second half brother , the same way for it 's like me .
mean , who can see light and dark , who can see how i 'll also see , where is'n window in space , whether it light , is or from .
what today , very convenient is for the switching them .
the , or we both can see , if us , it 's .
now street , but i say , i ca n't tell , is oder'n man es'n street .
the theme of the old men , too .
always have to keep trigger-pullers go up .
and what to me , but always was critical , and it 's already the fact , like so you trust and she takes just saw this great confidence that spezielleren that we all need , in'ne as something urvertrauen situation , the thing i time .
and the was for my parents definitely that you , how many of them , before my brother and i still does n't even blind people knew .
we were so the first , that then suddenly appeared in their lives geschneit are .
and then they had to from the situation of what do .
and from , because i , it 's a giant lucky that my parents than 185 farmers do n't affect the day long time had to us to stand and us , had the hand to lead or to say , there 's actually ne wall , there hinläufst you 've run along and then bissl feel , where you tastest .
a , that would be awkward been -- we have been home so rauhfaser .
and b , at our parents coming from beginning to us to think of them , always going to go , where we also our sighted brother is .
so , in the home alone runterzurennen that you up and rumzurennen , it also time to risk .
there has the blind brother me then with unter'n über'n what pushed spielzeugtraktor were used in .
the to the to do i have to today still .
this is that with the big brothers -- that are not only good for the elbow but also for the schönheitsfehler .
and our , brothers and my brothers and i we look at on farm that really that everything out , and what do you could do , especially for example , bike ride a .
and that has the are brother with people started with three years and then we wanted , they also -- michael and i .
and then started , with zackiger to drive , as i used to such a little kids , today with the wheel is this really bissl alles'n stützrädern .
until the kiddies that can .
but we have that still getting started with stützrädern suppose , without .
and then is the big question : how we will get an ma , there ?
and how do you get that trust , one that trust the parents that the children , eventually brought back from a jump up and nicht'runterfallen and the other faith of us that we do n't , where it 's move .
and our solution was that we course , from our parents tell us have , where are the is'n , so where there is a car , where risikostellen followers , where are may also time of an amazing things , sure enough homes -- that you put it now do n't get away -- there , we knew that they are .
and we had to us in between orient to us that one hand , so , but that will also hear .
and that you can now , in here , not all of testing , because otherwise , interestingly , here as loud , that they do n't actually more of have .
but heut evening when you might have a light switch off and in their bedrooms , or in the bedroom , more and then also want .
you can try , just durch'n associate with the tongue , so , to orient and they 'll notice that 's at us humans as well , but also -- they 're going to a resistance .
so how the bats that with zurückgeschmissen 'll also that you 're now also'n wall , kommt'n resistance because the sound different radarfliegen will .
and this is for me in trust , so trust , in the movement , always very important been .
but selber'n a backup to have , and the security , i have much better chance to me there auch'ne piece of helping .
and me just to orient without a big trouble and clear , oh yes , many accidents , the one or another there 's course , eh .
what i guess what today , no pictures more , that i very lieblingssportarten itself is , one of our bedaure also as children .
which is the climb on our higher state building on farm .
i picked up here 's written : the confidence that grows by a stückweit diversity .
and that my darlin ' i already very literally , because i as a person , a lot also later in coachingausbildung and in the pädagogikstudium with confidence in the scientific side to work with him , and 'm talking about one thing was never yes or when i have never as of how i 've experienced .
the it 's never leave you may also be read .
but also to do with that it clearly not everybody that 's just as an experience .
why biodiversity is in the way of our strengths with the most important to regain some point to know , where i 'm pretty well , what i talent and where i can just saw my strengths and folks also full ausspielen ?
and our brother 's all over again , who has michael and i 've always took on top of the house .
so has said , okay , we look at this is a dachfirst .
because you can probably somewhere out of windows hopfentrocknungsanlage of the rausklettern , for example .
and the subject was then the , michael afterwards and i blew it 's probably still so'n bit like that the girl playing , actually ne , i know not .
but the end : who 'd like the bottom ?
so i do n't .
and i think is the other , we are the generation of young women here , they did n't .
and so i 'm , then always with .
and then it was , the consequence that we will look at all three traktor dachfirst up around and the dad with his followers with aufm walked up and do n't even more know , what he now , to say .
because of course , then way , when others doubt .
if the father so we said , to god we now , aid , aid , aid , then about the threat of relative size been suggesting that one of us , too scared he would have and in runtergekommen -gekullert , -gesprungen , runtergeflogen -- i know not -- somehow zweifelsfall would be .
is , but never happened .
he had to wait , and then always been so zurückgelotst that he 's just might also again , zusammenreißen has or having said , the us then returned .
and that was what i want to me very great , that we have these opportunities .
but now , you do n't worry , that 's not a principal , not necessary to later leistungssport to make .
for me were the different is that in my life always important were , all , yes , interesting .
and all , they were all for supergut , because i 'll also could see , where i mean , what are perhaps so my heart .
so to werferin ner i would have never be able to .
i had never the oberkörpermuskulatur .
and i go to this does n't like in krafträume .
i go to today rather out in rain .
now also , not in five degrees like the moment .
and in strömendem rain machine -- but nevertheless , rather than the current .
but i 've always for me so that trust in my strengths in that i found that i different is that .
as the first example , judo .
and that was for me very beautiful , because there 's also the coach , the us in auch'n had , has said : ok , we have bought it , all these are children but send us judoverein couple of the blind children .
actually about it yeah well , because there you pack , each other at them .
and then you realize it 's true , what the other .
and there was always been so my big , trust of course , all right when i the a long will be happening in fact there is difficult , because then can the other perhaps , let 's what do , what i do n't mitkrieg .
so there 's just a way , and this is the faith in my new .
the other into a foot in the top , i find yourself backwards , the über'n head and then it 's sitting in the back and the competition is over , because the full of keeping score , there .
i 'm here 's not try out .
i had it me thinking about but actually ne square .
i think , that is now doch'n bit in time .
and i would have here also now , not a volunteer , right ?
others .
crap , i dacht already .
okay .
the next to me that was as a sports in school , then the biathlon and just sportskilanglauf .
my parents were home or are until today alpinenskifahrer and that they 've also make us taught me as children .
but for me was always in the school , it matters : how can i spend as much as well , the school move to my excess energy getting rid ?
and there , i had then a way in school , langlauf to make .
and although i personally , i thought , that 's all so langlauf boring , because bissl is something for the past more , because i .
and i used -- like today i 'm not anymore .
i then eventually said , well , i 'll do with the langlauflehrgang .
and then you know why do n't affect them , man , again , is the great diversity here in the sport , because you very much needs , you need power , a good coordination and it teamsport extreme is'n .
klingeling -- you may have a lot also from their work recognized ?
now that is it also in langlaufen .
you will only then quickly , if you just saw this thing you have faith in the own humble technology has .
if you that confidence in the own power has -- so the power to optimize the men 's also , then , every conditions that , the bad weather that , the soft snow , the vereisten snow lands on the skiing bring skills .
and if you in my case you also have faith in the team has .
because when begleitläufer that do n't see , i 'm sure , on auf'n sportlerin .
and me is still never have that starts happening today -- i have to the word -- my vorrednerin -- there 's just one -- has already today even my practice thinking .
but nothing , we make them yet again .
specifically , i erspar to tell you might just time .
do with a , one , one of them more later still a different kind of practice .
what i which is always make the topic is trust , is the exercise , that i kept the listener , just imagine making such as it 's so , if you ca n't see that berg'runterzufahren to make scaffolding , which stundenkilometer'n langlauf .
the isses langlaufen this : you has two sticks in the hand .
therefore , right , i 'm not in your hand , more free , otherwise might i mean , my darlin ' lorbeere take and myself the blindenstock feel them .
n't do .
so i have to me different helping .
i then my begleitläufer , in front of me running .
and the explain me with the voice of the route .
so the needs to address that exact ansagen do .
and also that 's important for trust .
the precision on in the communications , so in the ansagen .
and the rechtskurven tell me just always links- , if gradeaus goes , who can tell me hopp and begleitläufer , the would say , left on every 11 , then i know it 's easy to left , so the upper part of the old-fashioned technology with the pointer .
if he says , left on a little sharper left , and when he says , right on 10 .
okay , all understand ?
then natürlich'n isses problem , because then i have to go or he has to me think again , then i know , so this , now is what do n't .
and for me is that very large , which is , if the ausliefern ago i 'm going , then i have to the really completely begleitläufer to break a negative to say .
to promote positive way to say , he 's for me that tool , that it enables me to that matter , really then quickly to be and in optimalfall also faster than others , the him in the competition .
and that i can only , if i just do , with both arms me durchzuschieben , me abzudrücken , on a leg to stand and i need to really the eyes to make -- ha ha , or `` can you also open , yes , nothing .
and to then this so'n and to then on the other one leg and similarly , again and here fahrn bit further , but to actually spend as though .
also with high shoes .
yes , and this is for me that very key , if i realized , ansagen 'm just quickly : how begleitläufer i know , the guy to say , so i tell guy , because i actually just men as schaff had , what do i just to say , hey , you have to me the right langlaufen do , because the right , who can see ourselves .
the do n't so , what he tell me to .
so i get the one that him the way for communications that i just to open .
and that 's like in every one thing .
if someone my needs n't know , he can tell me , we do n't help them , but there i am just wondered , and must say , well , i need of you the curve , maybe bissl schon'n used to make caregiving cool .
or i need of you like now , but that you just showed me also says , how long after the mountain is , because if we the pfänder up , because you think at some time : now , it must be .
and kick in how and that thing we want you just not on .
and there practice , i then also the pilot , like walking is , on sechzehn forward , the me , we have unfortunately only 20 minutes left behind us , because we may -- so we look at a recent times sechsundreißig minutes to -- then are , but rather tandem .
so is that for me , very important , there 's also the of salt , the ansagen have them .
i 'm like pfänder -- here 's easy to get some other , the also auf'n gemurmel driving ?
who is more ?
so my best time here has been times faster , but that was in september and now so in april , may i eventually , actually still never as much faster , she did like there .
and once in the weather conditions for the moment fiese'gschicht .
and for me , as i said , are those of ansagen only then as possible , if i mean to open .
the other just showed me , exactly explain , what he sees me and so the possibility that there is my risk , perfectly on .
and this is for me one of the very important things why i say , trust is more and not this banana blindenvertrauen .
so , of them as a blind computer , not as much , frankly , -- from blindenvertrauen .
because i also the experience was thrilled to me a begleitläufer the right , and left , though he had .
and then was the one in a stab at the bad , because there 's next to the way across three meters runterging .
and i 'm the three feet just runtergestürzt .
so -- as i said , that was then -- of course klar'n on them .
i know that also , because the ansagen must mean time , turn around , to so spiegelverkehrt begleitläufer .
and me it happening today still , that i got people say , left and say then , you actually ne , the other left .
so was then , right , unfortunately .
power in the everyday life often not so much .
but now , you in so'ner situation with pressure , we realize that you probably also all of the work or the college , anyway , if oh , walk to .
and then of course , is very often bisschen'ne so'n hard challenge .
but for me , as i said , which means is trust me just scientists , that i the risks of language must .
and there i have to be honest say , i am more than , someone does n't see , relative size of the advantage , because i kenn my risks in many ways .
so , kenn langlaufen ' i now so all .
the driving kenn tree , from the slope down kenn that i know , and i tiefschnee but of course -- and that 's the important -- i gegen'n also the good news sites .
the universe is actually , impossible to , if that trust that there is .
and if you , somebody has found , the men 's really also a hundred percent so ansagt , as i just need .
and with the i know , also the same carbon targets .
because this is for me in the subject of trust me just the next , absolutely crucial .
you need the goal and i have to address that actually also clear to , which is about it because really , trust also gives us ?
because of the is often so'n faster and the , you would , used .
i trust the or the or i plunged ourselves .
but that matter is yes , they say that in , too much depend on .
that you for that you for trust a lot preisgibt .
and that you also -- because we people all with ja'n irgend'ner got out -- we want irgend'nem that sense see .
and the sense , which is very often that just as we also create , rock 'n goal to achieve .
that we do this -- in my case , for example of some yes , weeks ' i am i on the klimandscharo gone .
and there wusst , i need : i have to me now , then they look for a blog , or the i in the case , so can count that i just saw this mountain top to .
and how do you the then that you go on the mountain view , at some really up ?
well , i had course the most benefit . i got some things right now did n't see , if it for example , beside me a hundred meters runterging .
then i was that 's relatively unknown .
can druchaus'n be an advantage , it is that is no problem .
and i get heavier , in college , that worked , now , despite the hoteldach am i and to the whalers ' i then that be done nem abgelassen or 'm in berlin stahlseil flown 5,000 days , because you will be with so'nem baseflying bungeesprung of wie'n klimandscharo .
that 's already runterfalle bit scary , then when you up there 's and down the cars can hear , then you have to still not much see , there to know , now , do n't hurt , if i so'n .
and things like that are for me always been quite interesting .
now , you also the zusammenreißen to have , but to be easy to know : hey , i war in the price down , when i think there are so yes focus , adrenalinkick and can simply by anything but also a new new experience .
and that 's exactly isses so'nem bit about the way klimandscharo , because in auch'n mountain isses this : you go on every day after 10 hours ago , and it 's time , they just hold still get
you go and goes and has just skim stones , around , and more , plants .
you take the der'n ranger with , anfang'n rifle . the first world .
so if you erlegt who sees , it is the ranger about the last , the mal'n .
the only then so that the exciting .
we have the other just from the distance ever seen or the other .
so wurme ' i ranger a faith in the doch'n -- despite his silly hatt that he had .
because i thought : well , so , as i said there renn ' i probably at a way , how to the that thing you load .
but as i said , it 's otherwise , pretty sich'rum , because you wait to eintönig actually now not so much change .
and really exciting , interestingly , then , if something hard to exist .
so if you then in the height go and the air thinner .
or if it to a very , then when you so'n little line , where the left and right off .
then it 's particularly beautiful and if there 's and then also still accounting night is and all with him bergführer , it has been to us the rumrennen already also said : now he would be me to describe the wire , so he then i was also really in terms of and in the grip .
because when i only without light there rumspringe and that was him , but sometimes to be risky .
trust , we 've created , that i just said , well , i can course of mine who , my girlfriend , the was , a hundred percent of trust , i abgesprochen you and we have that before good kenn .
but i need also actually shape of security , so i 'm not permanently focus to be , because , you can imagine , if you on the mountain just always say links'n stone , right to focus on one , left on every 11 .
there will you look at some kirre , and everybody is .
so is for us faith in the case , historically , we 're looking for baumelnden connection , so ham , we a rope , your backpack goes to create that i had in the hand and then behind her , unless i uns'ne rope has gone .
she had in the other so'n wanderstock that i also with hand'n little bit of the range of them .
and it 's then eventually , to do with the foot gegen'n stone had or has with their wanderstock auf'n rock on that i just might also had already , which is on me ask if and i was not , just focus had .
and what i looked at the men 's really has shown , how beautiful it 's actually , if you course realized then eventually , because the peak getting near that while you that goal really so again in around the corner -- just like we also see , the langlaufen , to go .
other thing is it but also the case that i realized that trust that i in me that is who only there , now if i really so'n goal as a sort of the high-water mark .
but that trust is also down , there , the mitkriegen , like trust , just work .
when we then at night i just the mountain hochgelaufen are , we were in the group of forward and behind us are the other seven in the and the were always sort of dense behind us and it has been , everybody pause it was somebody else behind us and i 've already thought : tell ' time , why the because why this because everybody that he 's seeing behind us can walk ?
at night , you can also the girls not from behind look at .
this is somehow not the reason to .
and then i eventually the time , ah hah . ok , right , their faith in their skills is that also at some pretty mürbe .
you go there at night by the darkness , you go to 12 , then , no light .
this is totally up , if you vergügenssteuerpflichtig is , the air is being thin , so really only still up and now , is not übermüdet first place .
and then it 's but eventually , so the moment , where the , have said , yes , man , that was actually , hands-on , behind you to go , because the friend of me has just showed me all of , we 've constantly gequatscht -- like that women , so do .
have all the night of us anything about cancer and the other in the group right there 's also the result , noch'ne to know , ok , it 's now just bestärkung hour , that has they told me then told .
or i said , you what 's very different now do n't even the mountain into telling .
and that to me to know , it 's still somebody 's blog , it may also just bad about -auch about maybe we have time talking about -- it are only still too hour , the sun goes as soon on .
exactly this stuff , and devdutt also used mirrors from the outside can trust and significantly increase and can contribute to that you so the personal gold medal but just as well .
and for me is trust , then given and is all , then perfect , if you just so the personal gold and that , what 's really to achieve , then eventually , in the idea is there .
that 's kind of course , all right in in sports and with the gold , in that you so reinbeißt -- i know , actually also not why that 's make -- maybe , i know not to the value to test scores or to look , whether it to service , but this very is ?
so i think , for some medals that it 's so , in vancouver the were six grams a hard .
if this all the gold would be , stände i 'm not here , then i would on the bahamas , which i .
now , or in me , steuerparadies irgendso'n .
but as i said , i think that really , why you do that , is more that , you ca : what i actually been created and how i have my skills and forces focused on a point .
how i in me in my skills , but of course , the team that we all need , whatever , whether in studying , in the job in which one thing , whatever .
anyway , whether an old man or young woman , we need to just people , the milk , we trust .
and if we then that goal in the head clear , have eyes and that also have reached stores , is that the best proof that we at least in a project in our lives , trust us could .
and if you can , you can also , in other areas .
thank you
a science for me , is the title of my talks , which is drucklegung their maps .
what drives , is the very selbstverständliches effort , the sciences , again as something tiefsitzende in the general population to attach .
basically , i could be satisfied .
if i in a bookstore them , there 's all aufgearbeitet only with literature to science data subjects , the populärwissenschaftlich regalmeter is .
even though every verständlichen has a range of populärwissenschaftlich zeitschriftenkiosk newspapers , magazines , magazines , where the major issues , create stories , somehow get across the whole .
every station has at least a fernsehformat , where i give a major issues into ever be .
myself , that 's totally abstrus , if you look like , what it , magazines and magazines for children there with science data subjects .
every program has somehow include a to cut off in konsumierende , but yet , is this one of kioskregal story .
science is one thing that need , can i 'd like to see that can i 'd like reading , but that this as for me . some of itself .
cool , cool is science just sort of course , at tedxaustin , now , in breaking bad , somewhere , there are the chemist cool , much ?
csi so a dna-fingerprint five minutes , has nothing with the reality to do , but that 's cool , much ?
there , because i can identify .
big bang theory , because i can get a laugh , i understand the jokes not , but it 's fine .
this is extremely too .
because , that 's kind of a little paradox , not the future will we just manage to cope with such a technological issues and themes .
but at bay area that none for themselves , once .
i have a few little taste of things , like science , or we 're looking at us that in a given to have .
a very supertoll example : in london , you get a beautiful tower being built , prominentes , the architect , not so now , we build the time somehow so this curved .
what happens is , right now that the sunlight from up in this kind of falls , i realize that time has come out , you’re doing and then somewhere in the other you a point where do .
that went through the press , stood there , just a it .
so sad , the heat , there has been so you know that this poor außenspiegel , the really long , and has , there are the jaguarbesitzer ' time .
there she asks you , such a architect , has the n't actually somehow , a bit of what in physics learned , because i mean , is yes , that such a mirror stuff on .
now , which i found , it , there is that archimedes , sort of & , in about , where he , taken to rays hitting a fleet of an example .
because i ask really , what has the more design or an architect , or where he has been studying lung ?
now that 's a very akutes example .
a classic , which is given such enthusiastic about issues , it 's also the numbers .
and , that 's already now a few years ago , when that looked at less in the media .
there was the train has already that ship , because gentechnologisch changed the plants , that was her , a danger .
genes that was in with green for .
genes that were somehow what we first .
ne , oh , there are gene inside .
there 's situations , where on the market , really have : hey , i 've genfreies vegetables .
no idea what that should be , yes .
so , yes , okay , and tomatoes , we can fly over discussing .
but to the time i was in the biology , active in and was eventually , frustrated , because i 've tried , these evil genes in my bacterial mistdinger , these verfluchten einzuschleusen .
and was totally frustrated , came home , and my way back then she 'd say , you see that but not 's happy , what 's because this ?
i like this : yeah , i 'm trying 's been there are three days as a little gene in my bacterial cells to transform and this works at all .
it was the , what i 've tried , to explain to , so it 's a beautiful , gene , i thought , yes , does the lady , if i of genes speak , you know they already , which it means everybody .
it was the , what i actually meant , so one particular sequence that i studied there in these kolis verfluchten wanted to .
but it was the , what the woman who are perceived from .
this woman has never again the driver 's all !
who knows , what i do you anstecke , much ?
genes is what 's very bad outcome .
now that 's already 10 years ago , and yet , there has the way in awareness ones .
genes , that 's kind of what we first .
genfrei i 've long , is not read .
it 's then always in technology , and it has but really in our language there .
super-genmais europe , was a headline .
all different from a lot of other corn , the mit does not genes that contains .
and a headline writers , they rats to die .
yes , that was also a headline .
the are but not so old and it 's also have no matter , on what extent to where i find ways .
anyway , whether the time or the picture , all talk from all .
thankfully , it 's still not duden in inner arrived , but i 'm afraid , and that takes also , is not long .
but that simply shows , which insecurity in the population , because they simply not with the issues to engage .
nevertheless , we must in our future us with these technologies are busying themselves .
now was just bundestagswahl , nobody had the big on the topic , but it be about things are and elected , what the most really no idea .
and this is pretty sad .
how is actually , this information from the lab in the population ?
if we assume , this little boy , the scientists are sitting in his lab , has a little experiment , done something , and well , and he does is thinking about is , man , that 's quite what , that interested in the public .
then got to the undercover , the professor go .
the head , who decides , okay , very cool topic , his name on as this , that 's always important in the science , this gap .
good idea , i 'm still , not in the public , it goes to a pressesprecher .
yes , the pressesprecher thinks , oh , like a great idea , class , because we do a press it .
mhm , because we have an issue with a project , a fabulous idea , and that 's coming then some way out of ivory towers .
this is then ausgespuckt , yeah , but , who actually ?
now are to the rare alone , usually have multiple forschungsgemeinschaft so a common that , a shared forschungsinstitute .
and of all these are then the max-planck-gesellschaft , the really cool projects , will then over the helmholtz going to the magazine given , of the editors , no matter whether it leibniz , fraunhofer , pressesprecher or outputs are .
this is the way .
from the base is it on and filtered organically , in ivory up into the really , really cool experiments then that actually speak of projects , there in these people come up .
that are out a magazine that are really well done , there 's cup of all there 's free , yes , and to i mean that ?
so , basically just the the workforce , for being interested .
in the bekehrung we call that 's always the wissenschaftskommunikation the very much .
so the the workforce , anyway , for being interested in that they then the newspaper , yes , and good .
beautiful design magazines , reached the audience , the the workforce , for being interested , and the maybe about an idea , where wodrüber about it even in these articles .
who erreich ' i mean that but really ?
the was that need it anyway , actually .
the way , that was now , the the ordinary citizen , i call it might have a gentleman müller-schulze meier- , the circumstances other was reading , i tried , it 's not going to keep the , to i do n't really .
yet , again , our future will we just sort of what can , if we do with these zukunftstechnologien engage .
fracking , genetic engineering , renewable energy , meier-müller-schulze , that are all these issues , the hochkomplex are , the gentleman stammzellenforschung but not really understand and and over the he sort of voting .
my project , my idea is therefore , unlike that , these small , boys , you get this scientist out of the things to take , really completely from its regular fach-community to separate , and him a course to give , a seminar when you how to science entirely expected to communicate .
what is mostly it happens that a scientist so i have a buddy , we know that we 've been good about twenty years , he 's elektro-ingenieur , it 's at us a go unwritten rule , it not after his job to ask .
when he got the mouth go and over his career telling , he has us behind .
ne , that are scientists , the tell and then one of dehydrogenmonoxid .
ca , which said , for instance , ne , since it 's it almost like that same level like genes .
it treated , that is somehow , oh , you do n't know , what is .
the really to pass on , that 's beautiful and well , if you on a conference room and people , professionals , on dehydrogenmonoxid anything to tell you want , then you you like of augenniveau tell , but i mean again , let’s just water .
where is the problem , it really herunterzubrechen and normal to talk ?
i school , that 's my idea , these young scientist , the still not so far in the hierarchy vorangeschritten are , the still a little more malleable , that are the school i , how to get across the argument .
that has for all use , forschungsinstituten , , anyway , unsophisticated investors , the want to know what 's in the drittmittelgeber happens .
eventually , are also tax , which the there are used , so the need to actually also the to communicate .
but the these training , that 's just a story .
i want to you then also really a jury her sit and the project to discuss their project a jury , you , who does , honestly , even worse it is not , children .
there 's a quote , i do n't know , whether this is real , of albert einstein , if you do it 's not just explain can , then you do it does n't really understood .
so , the scientists from the lab to take and your project really to rethink , how can i that really quite normal they communicate ?
so the stories , there 's already several .
kinderunis are totally modern , is everywhere , in every university , common , but there also to i , basically just again , the very much .
who , because , unmenschlichen end of the city in the university , for some sunday morning , catching up there , a talk to hintertupfigsten day ?
these are the that it anyway , actually .
i 've got back to my zeitungsleser .
so , that are the people the workforce , anyway for being interested in that there 's move and there , one to go to get to .
that 's beautiful , there are any knall-puff-peng-experimente done , all these are satisfied , all these are happy , driving home , and this is it .
so i sit down i still on a second aspect to say , it 's not in this one einmal-vorstellen the project .
these scientists are also still get trained , how are actually children ?
because of really tough , have on the substance to reduce .
because scientists , how the research , and how children their world explore , is the same .
children are scientifically .
they do anything like learn the walk .
they try out what , it work ?
patsch , falling down , no way , does n't work , next to repetition , i change a couple of parameters , make it 's still time .
children learn science .
that are really error , try and forschungsprozesse , i look , what happens , which factors i change has to that it works or not .
this is normal .
but that have many unlearned it .
and therefore i think , really can work that just want , after the augenniveau and those scientists had permanently in the neighborhood , in the environment with the children of kindergarten , from the primary school , there in experiments make the kids , on whose patenschaft , and there , really do it with , because i believe that the children and the scientists are actually , basically the language to talk .
and then you can perhaps , maybe some point , that 's so my hope , tell the children that then also at home , and then to i also , meier-müller-schulze , a three-dimensional , then once for scientific dispute with very interested , because the children beside him that tell .
this is then not anywhere in the newspaper , that 's not anywhere , galileo , but his children to tell him , something that it gebacken mirror , with a hohlspiegel worked has that it 's have a bread mit'nem has that it there paper and has , and know what i actually , and shaking then might also the head , like a architect , so a house can build .
and not just to i then of course , zeitungsleser , but also the meier-müller-schulze .
this is my idea , my vision , my project .
unfortunately kommunikationsfähigkeiten it 's still is that the first testkandidaten that i 'd have to have said , yes , no way , so , hapert for our scientists , that this is just not subject that have generously in other priorities .
a scientist has to do n't want to communicate .
yes , i can think , okay , then i say that i the next .
but who somehow in a department to work , elektro-ingenieur is in a company , , anyway , there 's in the next is go .
thank you .
i 've gone mad , is the question .
you can also not every day .
the past weeks were terrible .
the weather has us a great is through the bill did .
seven , soon after eight years when i have been asked , whether i here that are picking up to .
i was ceo , almost 10 years , and i pfaffenhofen regionalflugzeuge in munich , and in dornier .
we 're there are quite far off , the first place .
had lufthansa as a client .
and for me it was actually rather , well , this is liebhaberei .
what is this really ?
luftschiffe , that 's actually completely ridiculous .
i but then they got to know who is and for that i 'm standing here today .
and maybe it 's a little nuts , but it is , so this , too high , emotionally .
it 's beautiful and always exciting and makes great fun .
and i 'm going to you just in the next 17 , eighteen minutes a little bit of this life of zeppelingeschäftsführers tell .
i 'm from ceos in zeppelinluftschiffbau .
the company , there 's been a hundred and fünft years .
i 'm full of the zeppelinluftschifftechnik .
this company , there 's been 20 years .
and ceo of the ezr .
the company , there 's been about three or years .
the the zeppelin here at the bodensee .
man .
that a picture that i do you here to show up , the little one point , i think that 's really that a rock paintings , such a was written on , or anything , do n't know , yes exactly this point is still going to big .
there 's because the only luftschiffe dreiundzwanzig .
and it , we 're really only still 10 active .
this shows what .
there 's about twenty or even thousands standing around world verkehrsflugzeuge .
so that 's actually not a market .
that 's also not a niche interest .
this is a exot , a unikum .
and the question is also , why do you do that then , i mean ?
how does it all ?
dreiundzwanzig the industry insisted and only 10 active , because we can and then , it 's talk about why this is .
so very quickly to the story .
graf has a bunch of crazy bezeichneter neunzehnhundert the back here 's started .
very short order .
has to luftschiffe fourteen years ago , the first world around neunzehnhundert the bullseye in '' .
then were in the first world , kriegszwecke man died by luftschiffe and join , been around achtundachtzig neunzehnhundert built for graf .
the know , london by and so forth and so on .
and when we did and eight to london got these are , and with a big doppelseitig there a dreimonatige campaign to fly , were the english major newspapers getränkekonzern filled with the headline said , this time they come up , , but not bombs , but in part of intent .
so that has the story in there again .
and we had an insane campaign .
but inbev , the customer , was not so very pleased to because he suddenly realized that 's gotten , what 's still stuck , which old memory in there 'd put them .
and well , that was , and for the marketing -- a pretty much critical .
but yet it was in london a good dress campaign except the weather in the north up there was many years ago , very bad and very windy .
and we 're not very much for flying .
then has eckener two decades , neunzehnhundert and hugo neunzehnhundert this has taken .
and has a reparationsluftschiff for that then to america and vigilante .
that has a myth now , that all the german nation of , again something felt , grander than resolution is vierundzwanzig and neunzehnhundert that to be implemented .
there was that then in in new york , with tape parade .
and all the german nation 's got out has hach , we 're back .
the black dots in all know that inside and this is something that explains a little bit further into the myth of this device .
but actually are then to graf and siebenunddreißig just five , six , seven zeppelins at all still were built and actually just two really big , the neunzehnhundert zeppelin and the hindenburg , the passengers promoted .
so , a hundred , where we look around luftschiffe passengers and hundertneunzehn , it was the end gesamt neunundsiebzigtausend .
it was but a myth .
and the todesfolge then this was at the first broadcast live are crash with there 's also , yes hindenburg-unfall .
next to the titanic that event at , where a one icon , a a product of clutter , is , and then also never more after the flight .
also the other devices .
and neunzehnhundertvierzig , neunzehnhundertneununddreißig the last still a bicycle in before .
the ways of the materials used for -produktion , kriegsflugzeuge , the a third-world budget .
then was too long did n't move around in years .
and then the had the friedrichshafen so gesellschafter and by , the scene had the idea , maybe to consider that comes back to start .
and i was hired zweitausendundfünf , because you do is , technically a great product has evolved , we come in a moment , but the market .
yes , he 's a market ?
what is there 's actually go ?
so .
talk about that we now .
the graft by saying is that perhaps , quickly explain to we look at all about it 's still , ne , people who has a lot of done before .
there 's many companies that go out of this very aware .
it are today achtzigztausend employees , about 20 billion of revenue .
that 's a real dependence very , the profitable .
there 's a lot of it .
the 've got me then also believe , here to come .
the zeppelin will , is actually a very ordinary could fly like any other small plane as well , but has , sorry , has so a gas , and not evolve hydrogen sulfide , and so we also a luftsäcken with gasmanagement .
is like a whale , the in the water on ground , and again , and since the druckausgleich to get out .
the time now is n't there , that in the details to understand .
inside it looks a man of it , with a structure .
there 's two varieties of luftschiffen .
there 's rigid prallluftschiffe , that we are , reibstarr in the case , and luftschiffe .
the inside no structure and the are sort of how up in zigarrenform .
these are the most luftschiffe , the in the world has been are , about four , a piece .
and there 's only today , as i said , only dreiundzwanzig the industry insisted on our own , so , it’s just two decades .
this is then the production from , if a shell where one of .
the left the structure .
and the shell is also do .
comes from the raumfahrttechnologie .
source : the raumfahrtanzüge the astronauts .
mondlandung then there are the origins .
one point two million dollars a shell .
and is to reißfest be , to uv-abstoßend be and also have to gasdicht be , because again and you have to yes , at that if a year in it would or a hole that it 's not tear it can .
there are doing the detailarbeit mitarbeiterinnen do and check out exactly , whether it 's going on holes in control .
and the end looks a controlled airship on without the community of like it 's there .
the zeppelin is so technically a hochausgereiftes product
and you see this down here the numbers . , very short time .
one point had nine percent , one point had nine percent , one point had six four percent sechzehn , that is from a thousand flights in the year , maybe ausfallrate from .
that 's very very little and very good .
that 's a industriemarkt .
the can see .
but there 's a different trend , the us at about power and the have i ended up here .
we had three years ago percent -umbuchungen , when i started , ago , nearly 20,000 five , eight years ago , wetterabsagen percent siebenundvierzig and last year wetterabsagen percent fünfunddreißig or wetterabsagen .
and this year in may , we were in percent .
if you the eight years , my eight years , in the zeppelin klimaforschung and klimaforschung that produces want , then you can say at least in the eight years , obviously a particular the hinterlegt , also clear , in the eight years , there has the weather clearly changed for us .
we 're windabhängig .
we can train passengers ca n't go through thick fog .
the want to see is something .
and the umbuchungsraten or absage- , actually every year and smaller .
so a little picture of the fact that our weather , not just felt , but also statistically , because we do weather , every day , changes .
but because this is that is now the good afternoon , the e.u a program being remade klimaforschung to do , almost 10 million dollars and we 're a an integral part of this program .
i come this morning , just come from finland .
that in here is equipped them , is a flying lab .
pegasos is called the campaign .
and we do grenzschicht in the luftanalysen between the earth and 20,000 feet .
the planetary grenzschicht .
and the zeppelin t 's flying machines , italy , speak up to finland in a gesamtprogramm siebenmonatigen .
over many many hundreds of as a measure the and analyzed the air out how the , chemically function , how they respond to our things that we the ground do .
there , so i 've just explain , up there are we 're dealing with the second world in .
a great a great assignment .
and is that if you want concrete derived from the theme of weather .
that 's so very good .
and here are actually , a few people .
that in sweden last week or vorletzte week .
and in finland is by the weather super , ne , fünfundzwanzig degrees , 30 degrees .
the finns may say something that they had never .
i am i 've just wonderful , nice hot days experienced .
the they were then also do n't so bad .
we were also in africa .
and have for sondermission as beers diamond cell for innovation , better , `` for that the are , the in these are by running through 150 million years .
just , this can also ask , is that 's all over africa , is that then a more sense if you make sense of questions , after an idea of questions , according to make sense of questions is it makes sense if at the theater at the film bloody or your diamond 's gone .
there , then i wondered , you know what do we actually ?
and what we actually ?
the end , we were two years , then also done .
the way of this was then also not on .
the entire zweitausendacht came back then weltkrise and the project was then .
and a tornado hit the zeppelin the mast then at that damaged , that he also the bottom could .
but not so bad .
we had very good for insurance , and they were quite a very happy .
that was looking at the prototype .
and i did n't know what i want to do with .
yes , what we now do , a very brief lehrbild from the image of the bit .
what we now do , it 's just said , it 's the complexity , it goes to ask , growth or she insisted .
what we now do is the friedrichshafen here in luftschiffbetrieb .
we do to service of course .
we we need to the zeppelin was always get .
obsoleszenz called an aging .
there are always as well , inside , after 10 , i do it again , the be replaced to .
we replace the entire avionik-system for nearly five million dollars .
there with the clients goodyear talk about that we still .
we do we need to the grundentwicklung constantly doing .
we 're a little lufthansa , the kind of the germans luftfahrtaufsicht and of the european a controlled , will always to and the time , with more like zugelassener , or how we also have .
that 's also aufwändig and costs money and got ta carry on and also going to get .
the question is : do you actually on ?
you want to develop ?
you make greater luftschiffe ?
there 's luftschiffe , cargo-luftschiffe .
what do you there are really ?
you go further in the market ?
you go further in the ?
and the course we have in my time also try them .
and there , we 've also some niederlagen suffered .
how the way , the niederlagen by some graf suffered it has and this bust .
the beginning , on the billboard charts , it was the a donation of neunzehnhunderacht .
the population of german age population has led him at that saved with six million goldmarkt as a donation , as the fourth in . was and he basically , he was , has the population him a donation .
and it 's all the stände luftschifffahrt zeppelin and the other companies , otherwise we were or zeppelinkonzern today i do n't here and also other companies would n't there .
we were in tokyo , traumstadt .
we were , and you hear the past , in san francisco with a customer .
behind it was a very much more investor .
both of projects are actually failed .
so we also niederlagen .
simultaneously , we have goodyear won .
i 've got no image , because we that goodyear could still not show you can .
but just in america is now the luftschiffes on the first goodyear-bau in the finished .
we have three piece sells .
with goodyear we create a , with a partner that , the technology .
and that 's a huge success , but at the defeat .
two customers are essentially , has been , because it 's not went .
why it was not ?
we know it actually already .
it was the location not the right or the passengers had to prallluftschiffe or in america who knows everybody knew you anreisen the last 30 forty years , the commercials have done .
the ham people have prallluftschiff , have that ever seen , have said : oh , again , a , again , a heraufgeschaut , the power of advertising .
there can the did n't realize that you go there mitfliegen can .
and it was actually , twice as difficult in marketing foods that 's death to face : hey , people , and going .
bodensee going very good .
the pilots who transfers food in the year , transport , embrace dreizehntausend , zwölfttausend passengers .
but last year we 've just elftausend done because of weather .
there 's missing then once a half million .
this is then bad .
the zeppelin flies sechzehn are here .
it 's the sense , the course is , if i also when ceos , then see how the passengers would get out and and and all laughing and we basically , she also do n't do advertising , because it 's mouth to speak about and again and we got about dreizehntausend sold their have and the people say , that 's so beautiful , and highly recommend it your friends , known and who also on , in the family .
and we 're great that .
which way , i clean up to do with the mistake that you think we 're there .
you could always harder . flights to life .
we have so a bodensee the nimbus and we are out there .
so that is actually also , we do .
we do advertising .
this is a project has been , that 's sponsored by .
and an audi claimed that made here with the island mainau together .
but the werbemarkt is a difficult to market .
and you must therefore , also the sinnfrage imagine : makes sense ?
we 've actually enough ads , but the internet has much change , the großsponsoren over the launch , because the flugverbote everything that control .
the luftschiffe is largely weggebrochen , it 's why you today is still 10 active gewerbemarkt in the world .
we have three here .
two active , one packed , that goodyear , three has amerika-luftschiff bought , 10 percent are actively .
so are then six of 10 .
that means that we 're then the future , actually , if it at all of this is to control .
and hope , it also again a future in order to .
and what the conclusion , scott , commander of the apollo six , after his nicer paris 20,000 and five , he has said , and the walk on the moon what zeppelinflug .
so zeppelinfliegen you . ''
do advertising we also find you .
only we find any customers .
sondermissionen to do we find great , has a technological value .
because we have any customers .
that 's not be summarized .
it 's amorph , goes on and down .
so a so a government takes years until you ca n't , but what you .
and then there 's also , again , no .
there 's also this effect , the easy for and hard to control are .
anyway , is that the situation , luftschiffe , a point in global market , so actually not a market .
yet we doing on .
it 's an icon of the region .
the gesellschafter have the power it to make .
so what they just about the question : in which to shape we make it on ?
how much money we give up in the world ?
what do what do we for here ?
in which to form that supposed to run be ?
and i personally , they 've got me also asked to something very skillfully , to say i 'm sure , to my history back dornier , where where i eads rescue ever wanted , at large drag them , even dornier has the little dornier dead , you want , well it 's also here to rescue .
i was also even in that three years abrasierten , when i got out of vancouver island . am and this entire finanzschiff them 've seen , has me that looked academia , that when i think there are thinner .
and then there 's a spiegelatikelserie about greenpeace , in the money of these are and did n't know what they do with what should and almost to basically went to .
because they have speculated that the objects , it seems to is .
and i have three years , greenpeace was as finanzchef and now i am that here in the hope , a long future in the zeppelin to achieve .
zero , is that ? the house for seconds , i 'm not yet done , thanks .
applause
yes , thank you .
that are my three penalty points that i want to in the eighteen minutes to go .
why we are today in '' or plenty of ?
how we come to the person ?
and , basically what do ?
what 's what is it 's actually ?
we begin with our first point .
the first part is perhaps -- a pretty depressing .
but it 's also about you , right , the challenges to show .
a few years ' that still more difficult been , that , to understand .
that we have a problem have today , you know every child .
that we are environmental problems .
but it 's worth , and over time to suggest that are the challenges that growth , for example .
all kinds of umweltverbräuche are rising exponential increase .
if you put it to a historical perspective , looks like , the oil hits for instance , then that will be a very short episode in the story has been to be .
the moment we ca n't imagine that it somehow differently about , when that oil and again continues to go up .
you know the climate change , the last hundertfünfzig years .
some people say , which , you earlier , there 's time with , we look at the last vierhundertfünfzigtausend years .
that you can also humoristisch at , because i also in that .
you can also say , who needs because the glacier ?
you can also say , the ocean is far away .
but it goes then , yes , if you a little bit more closely with listening to compete , and the real grand challenges , to make things that it really to avoid , it is otherwise we 've just trouble in the ernäherung , in the health .
tropentage it turns out there days over 30 degrees .
and there 's what degree in our cities like in vienna , or graz , increasingly , bad .
it goes , came to the ernährungssituation , especially in asia .
you think , the himalayas , where the big jets come and the reisernten of notes on that works with water from the himalayas .
it 's about all , not the planet .
in the planet is that wurscht , what we do , there 's already too much larger environmental crisis .
and a , but it goes to us to the people , the algorithms , in in a radically altered the ecosystem decline very uncomfortable will live .
's the thing , is an biodiversity .
the deserts , expanded .
the water will always be less .
this is the aral sea , where there an integral part of cotton from .
and that everything , where that come from ?
all these bad things , let’s ' i time , stuck in the one or another form with the global resources together .
with the , what we all of the ground , as what we harvest .
not just , having the oil and the valued metals out and the minerals , but also the renewables are , renewable , but the end scarce .
and we shall just look at that we so little as possible of them to consume less likely to also all , less food waste and cutting emissions to produce .
so it goes , is that 's in the introduction said already been the whole use really to dramatically reduce .
this is the challenge , not only climate , not just c , you two , umsteigen of a car on a different but really differently to live .
another way to rebuilding economies .
our technology has been trained to change .
if we still time for a look back the hunting and moving forward , and there 's still , on the earth societies , the in principle that life , come with a ton of the year per person and year .
in a agrargesellschaft were doing it in the longest time the human history of three to five million tons .
today are it fifteen to fünfunddreißig .
so verzwanzigfacht , there has this from .
and he 's very , unequally distributed on the earth .
it 's in north america 's still more than with us in us still more than for the earth is unsustainable .
and in other parts of the world , you look on africa , really much less .
and there 's , we call the implications of us , the rivers , the air is much better become in the last decades , but it is fundamentally , is that we that in other parts of the shift .
and the other parts of the way , the but more , like .
and will also the conflict that we see , ukraine in , is , afghanistan , where you look at them in the maps of the american geological survey and then you see , where the resources from .
and this is there is it there are very colorful , which means , there 's many materials there , where the krisenherde the world are .
so if we do with clean up to succeed , we to do with the subject to engage .
so we need to change , the ecological limits are everywhere , the ressourcenknappheit is everywhere .
and that , what we here , verallgemeinerbar have life is so not tollem .
that has already the mahatma gandhi who happened when he has said , the world has enough for everybody needs , but not to anyone 's greed .
and there we are , like we here and the average life is a much about it .
so .
this was the algorithms , this part .
but i think always asked to the needs to understand it 's also , what to change .
also if i asked afterwards they would say , it 's worth , too much like so , to the way to live , which is more their .
but it 's always again , in other from the one 'rauszukommen you need a rationale , let’s ' i time .
now , which is actually their ?
and there we need to find that we in our parts of the world the so much , then you have an economically , for quality , pretty standard of us and the average often do n't feel comfortable .
here 's a pretty good mood , but there 's people , and you 've also people , the not all that good can deal with this story .
i wrote that there .
burnout and climate change have the same cause .
we 're working to a lot and to do .
this is , on the side that we get yourself in stress , and eventually it 's too much .
i 'm also very like .
and on the other side of we just saw these resources .
what but then is a good life ?
how we can that defines what ?
now comes , having a a fraction of scientific and .
this is also , what i 've said , and what i later tell me is scientific , grounded planes , but it there 's hear that particular drum , how can i that , first time it is that ?
and there 's important , to understand better life has always two aspects .
life has the aspect of the objective conditions as it goes , what i want to eat .
i was a roof over the head ?
i 've been friends ?
i relationship , i can live in ?
but also , like it 's hear me , so i like . ' i find ourselves with it ?
i nenn that sometimes the perceived quality .
and then möcht ' i two words on this , the college , to work .
this one 's needs .
the needs are the very fundamental to our human development , our lives there 's drum machines to feelings .
if we our needs we can , then we 're happy .
and needs , you ca n't say , needs are sustainable , or not sustainable .
needs , still not to avoid .
what are needs ?
you can scientists like . i got here 's only two .
and there you course the physical needs , but also need for safety , social relations .
after protection , according to participation , and i 'll begin , creativity , spirituality , all of freedom .
all this has a bit of what with money to do .
but to a large part of men 's not actually , but the question is , how can i that in my life delicately set up .
and there i am in the second important term .
the strategies .
the strategy that i 'm using the me to 's available to me that needs to perform .
and there 's what they then you , right , that i can , with a high resources or with a low blood from doing .
because i can actually much money or a little money need .
we 're just saw my devils behave like i think about my needs befriedige .
that has to put my values related to design , the resources , with the possibilities that i have .
if i kind of money 've got wind ' i different from my needs to try to satisfy as if i , much money on the bank account .
it goes well first round the höherwertigen , is the roof over the head , to eat , and then , the grundbefürnisse .
and here 's what they then you , right , that can do with a lot sooner or a little harsh conditions , that can , sustainable , or unnachhaltig be .
and if we all the strategies that leads me available to stand to my needs to satisfy , as then we talk about one of lifestyle .
so .
this was the front of scientific and .
and now let 's drum from what we can do now ?
how it is how does it ?
and there just a couple of reasoning .
now , we have to that , also for themselves will find .
but these are the the individual flavor of on a technological way , here is , which i , a lot also about technology has been talked to have come and finally , also on a political leaders that .
what we can do ?
what we can do ?
what we do ?
so , where we want to go ?
the slides , contractors have a woman , said , the danger is that we are , in fact , and more affluence , and more resources .
all , the quality goes down because also the effects and worse , be human beings , and on us all , back locally .
or , whether we do it really , there in a different direction go , the with less resources , maybe with less mindful consumption , but with a higher quality that are connected .
there 's one of my ökoeffizient , maybe even know him some , weizsäcker of ernst-ulrich the this topic lehrmeister rate , quality with less resources .
there 's hear much technology like i can every single thing that we use the computer , the orange juice , the coffee and the car , the traffic , how can i felt that ?
that i can today , not of , i can make the house of wood , etc .
to be with a much less resources more or the same quality to create .
my other teachers , serviceeinheit materialinput has this needs to put it , the bleek per friedrich-schmidt , and since we 're at the , what today , already discussed have been is , there 's hear very deep sense that on a company to look .
where are actually the needs ?
what we can i really satisfy us ?
and how can i that with as little from doing ?
and it 's not with a little bit less , but more achtzig , fünfundsiebzig , out of those less .
there 's many examples of that , can .
in vienna , to which is like a be built with six to you .
with seven are allowed is it in vorarlberg already built .
that fundamentally , from wood , is to .
that you , if you may recognize it in fifty years , is not need them , we can and then again in its parts and not , so that , very much less resources out it with everything else you go from there , the moment , over half and the goal is with a fifth of the ressourcenverbrauchs , over the whole life span the house ever thought it with this one fifth of the ressourcenverbrauchs long before .
it goes but also a lot in our own human beings , how verhalt ' i actually leads me ?
die-tretmühlen-des-glücks has a book written , binswanger .
where he shows to show how it all , is , really from the from the algorithms , from that 's come out .
the statustretmühle , i want me , apart from the others come along , and then i 'm like , you 're in this in this race inside .
you yourself , but that i quickly getting from , and then they do i the new .
the most beautiful because i the zeitspartretmühle , that you know of all .
when i my institute in some years ago , we 've still receiving letters started writing .
then you have a woman , wait until the letter back now that i can email , is a massive zeitersparnis .
for that i hundreds of emails .
and i can very much more afford .
this is productivity , that 's economic growth , we come to that in .
but i did n't really time it saved .
i have to me to be done .
but there 's good examples , slow food for example , where i really , the claim the quality and the claim the genusses in the foreground .
and with a small level from more of you .
one of my favorite examples is simplify-your-life .
there 's a best-selling , you has about that a average person we had in germany , in austria , about 10 things in the domestic .
you can start to count .
who two , three generations of things that had had employees , personnel .
the have of the end .
we need to myself to deal .
and , fewer people come together to make sure enough , with these all options .
and need a field guides , the us to help them , the us coacht with these few things go .
if only thing i really interesting , maybe is that , you can use the spaceship that we can go out , which i say , is not thousands of things like .
the next example is use instead of having .
a true boom .
star , cebit , time-magazine , there has a woman , maybe twenty years ago or less in in alternative , you were evolved .
meanwhile , use it always more people , if you air-b-n-b thinking .
if you why-own-it thinking .
platforms , business models that just to work , where do you the things that we already have this beautiful aula here , the brink of a few hundred years was built , still , so to use and still about the centuries to use it 's about the end .
that , what even invested was just better to use .
that 's all , also a question of justice .
i showed you before , how things that 's take you that as a picture between africa and europe and a one and the world .
in fact that all the bacteria with these resources to do that 's only then as possible , if we really can use less .
and that means that 's actually not less quality , because of us has already , much to have .
but it 's an important task of the economy , the company , these products , those services available to imagine that we need to us a good life to create with a much less resources .
last point , that has also something with the big , to do nenn after the growth , wirtschaftspolitik ' i found that time .
if you a little attention deficit of the reading , it 's been back from below oecd , wifo , now that eu-kommission every week are these predictions again , looking down on .
it means , yes , a crisis 's in the door , my view , and also the people , , what we are , very much with the economists 've talked and with listening have , here are the numbers for austria , you find that , for all countries growth is go down .
and there 's no reason , growth to have , the way that as i think that from my youth , from the 1960 years know .
to entry part has that in math reasoning reasons .
one point five percent growth is today , so much like eight percent growth . fifty years .
and that eight percent is that , what china today .
the are also about there , where we may ago fifty years were .
overall , if the pie bigger is , of course , well , eight percent of his game .
the one percent is still , much , so we will be good living there .
but you must , impact on it up , that is , not even if we zero percent growth would have to be that yes , the next year just as much longer producing and consume and income have as in this year .
that we can invest and so we can work .
that 's also why not all that all backwards , because you these statistics knows that can show that growth of things are already , is not with the quality together .
the economy grows , but the quality of stays in in developed countries , living on the state of high-powered , we are .
and the way , jobs are also without growth as possible and that depends not all that deeply connected together , like this tells us again and of juncker and how they all you will .
so that is simply not and then you must have found , with the person to engage .
and it 's coming again , and increasingly , that , you also wirtschaftsmagazine like a more or next week , which i , in comes in the trend , a larger story with this start on , through .
already serve birds . edward a difference , of nobel prize in his should with this is that he has said , the good life the good economy , the good old nobelrede zweitausendsechs the good life .
it 's about all , and not to not primarily because the returns to create , not primarily to sustain growth to create what for our countries do n't even more about .
for these and these countries , also for china , for india there is the a very different story .
and that will only then it also under gerechtigkeitsaspekten , if we there , still growing and we simply , impact on this level , on this high level of high-powered , we 're good life and economies .
it 's also politics .
it takes goals .
it takes some indicators , say the economists .
it does n't just kind of the growth , but we should actually look , and measure and ask , what 's actually flavored with the quality , goes up the to ?
is the down ?
then we 've also our politicians to measure .
of course , how is the resources ?
how does it , together ?
we need a fundamental aspect of is the , from finally started to make and not the work .
which of you 're particularly the entrepreneurs live under them , but also the employees , you know that very good .
what , to walk away , we know , in any time a colleague paid for .
that you could do differently .
the resources , reduces and therefore , among the resources in place and not the work .
and you have to the end all politikbereiche to transform the engagement to create to figure out to ensure health , infrastructure , without growth .
that goes , but you have to play , this , having a little bit better .
that means that conclusion , more or less hatred , all levels in this direction , ever be , we can be hard , we can than ours are the right products , services firm than consumers of us questions , what we need to actually , who do that what is , good for us ?
what we need and what we need may not ?
the right politics , the framework .
a couple of clues as i 've given .
and the end of course also the science neunundneunzig percent of all around me goes , still in the way , how we can be the growth you ?
but unfortunately , nobody ever done .
if you the projections look if you the development look at the last two years , it goes down because it 's not about .
the politics does n't and the fellow will not growth create , but this is the question how we go with the presidency , so that we have a good life of them have ?
so , let 's do it .
so you want to lake .
with heart , the brain , hand and all , also the now we will have to do .
thank you .
i 'm salzburger gebürtiger .
and i love this town .
this city has been so many stories to tell .
one of that has a few hundred years happened .
and has to do with creative problem-solving .
on this creative problem-solving i get the same , and on the story a little bit later .
they will have to do with the citadel hohensalzburg .
this is a burg , the here in the middle of this city , and so much of this city , your mind , and it .
a different story about before .
it was a hot summer in to , nevada .
a man is , like at once in his shoes so that it right dampft .
that he 's warm .
he 's europeans , he knows that 's not so with the heat .
he does , one he pulls the room itself takes a knife fackelt also not a spike in the thing , which is a power of holes in .
he pulls the room itself again , there 's not be the way and notice he has a new climate in shoe .
it 's the shoe store , breathing , born .
and this number that you see here is the place in the one of these , had the polegato is today .
a company is neunzehnhundertfünfundneunzig , with four letters .
the a or another kind of you know it .
he has the original idea nike even and adidas are offered .
both have died .
so he says , well , fünfundneunzig , i 'll do my own business .
zweitausendvier he goes into the stock market .
now several thousand employees in a hundred of businesses in about achtzig countries around the world .
so much to the subject of creative problem-solving .
why not something new to make up , what 's still not there is ?
and birds . maybe the question put the risks , wideg can hear it .
if you wideg still do n't know , it is for what is this an opportunity ?
this question that has to me , for quite often have it , in tough situation .
if something wrong fluke is or my collaborator they told me or technology does n't work or , whatever .
wideg , little fuzzy memory , wideg .
what is this an opportunity ?
and you get from lösungsdenken the problemdenken .
what the difference can möcht ' i do with this example here to illustrate .
and a different example of the on this collected , through the versicherungsnehmern up out of eingereichten .
and the core evidence , like creative people who can be , if it to their own insurance .
i want to you a few examples here show .
the so these are actually so , in the search on this and that has to use it also a very done .
i love the awesome .
my son has the woman does n't umgerannt .
he 's just luftzug , and what is the wife by the vorbeigerannt there .
or , i had all day plants is when i the one at the rim , grew up a sudden the bush in my field and i could this other car will not see more .
very clearly , who 's a weighty thing is , right ?
the boonies .
the beigeheftet are unfallzeugen .
i 'm schwerkrank been and two copies a nearly died .
because they can tell me , but at least half the sterbegeld in on .
the last thing i was the crash n't blame .
blame was the young woman in minirock .
if you 're a man , is another explanation obsolete .
but if you a woman who are , you know about it anyway , not .
so people are creative , we 're creative .
and i wish i , and dreams , that we all more of creativity use .
many of us are in a schonhaltung freizeitorientierten .
and that does n't have to be that .
why not things just do differently ?
old , things that we do , the code that there are , the us may already be bored , or überfordern , as opposite .
why the not just do differently , that gedankenstütze , as a little simple ema-prinzip .
and there 's so findige company , the use that .
for example , a-ständer that have these gastronomen of their path run , these signs , or the wall , for example , and there is then maybe so what it .
also a way , right ?
the coffee pot to stay rather than , mitgehen .
or so what .
we have no eye , unterhaltet you .
is today is already know , right ?
if you the mobile phone n't even just type of .
or eat them with me , otherwise starvation , we both .
you have is , but creative .
so something needs .
i if only one of the client or an environment that then go inside , and say , okay , that i like .
that probier ' i might .
a german sichthöhe has typically , you the current day aufgeschlagen , which is in seminarhotel .
once the sport once the current economic news , once upon politics .
if you , there 's three on the loo was there is that you topinformiert .
even got the complaint about to long wartezeiten the food .
it 's a denkmalgeschütztes building and this restaurant , very small , so had the chefs take all of hands of business .
it was to look closely .
the 've ever thought , collectively , what we do ?
how we solve the problem ?
we can not faster be in the kitchen .
this is .
on every table is a but mörser basilikum set an olive salt , pepper plants and a strauß .
so that , in the people in the waiting to eat their pesto hey , putting yourself going to praise .
just time different .
a creative idea , , and perhaps with the wideg-frage solved .
there 's a person the power , currently not just popular .
you that person is the leader in the lokführer , so the gewerkschaft the lokführer .
and currently streikt of german trajectory .
the second day , and that takes down , because monday , so four days .
a company has nothing weselsky to the staff of the month 's chosen , and you have no may already , which you .
a transportunternehmen says , rather like , we thank you .
the people come to us is mietautos .
the buses are full , it will enable run , people to organize their keys , she because each of course , other because of punch it , from a , to b .
but why not conveyed , also tend to be something to use and creatively from his biggest disadvantage do something like ?
sometimes what happens , creativity also ungeplant .
and it comes from a hoppla maybe out , like this company that you might .
so we 've never knew that it 's where it at the übersetzern n't really goes well , but that they accumulate in the smartphone-sparte also , saving to it this is something rather alarming .
or the duftbaum in the car .
because we 've seen the different , flieder , and all possible directions .
yes .
why not a piece from the car on , if you dadrauf it 's right ?
or in ortstafeln there 's also have no way , the creative to make up .
and all that has to do with humor , with happiness , sometimes it 's really dumb , much ?
sometimes it 's funny .
once was my zweieinhalbjähriger son in my place in the office .
and sitting on this drehstuhl me .
so , we have multiple besprechungstisch around the drehstühle .
and then he 'll turn from left to right , he has internal joy , and i held in the elternmanier let’s go to the wake up , you stop on , that 's not a playground here .
he to me , they look at me , big eyes , at the playground .
and in the moment dacht ' i actually , he has been right , right ?
why is that 's not a playground today ?
why is that , what we do n't really , the playground for adults ?
that if only much more sense , right ?
if we are relaxed , if we our talents , use do that , what we like to do .
and so as excellence in pursuit , but it relaxed way .
that dip to is that , if a particular day the week 's coming then it changes , what in our brains .
it 's the first day in the week and somehow it 's our focus on a different day .
so one other day , we have , rather .
so in the weekend .
this sounds you also have already in the media .
at having is yes , only a day until the weekend .
or if then the most beautiful time of the year we will , the vacation .
what are then the rest of achtundvierzig weeks of the year ?
it 's dreadful ?
we 've all so now those jobs ?
a kultmagazin it had a time on the front given , this topic .
yes , it can i and the rest of life you ask yourself .
or on instagram , on facebook , all over the social networks is this issue up .
once was i 'm going through the salzburg , one of the haupteinkaufsstraßen in getreidegasse .
there 's a lot of business and i look at the like this .
what have the so in the auslage , what there 's like this ?
and one day soon i get in this business with these people to buy .
and the first sign , that you see here , yes , that 's quite a very nice .
so , riddled with this love doing that instead of work .
i kenn that yes , but also am a father of five children , but i love my work anymore .
yes .
or a silence for idiots is that have a sign .
why that your mindset , the doc , it becomes , which is increasingly , and always on .
somebody a present time as an answer on this direction posted it 's not the monday , it are your jobs .
and i ask even in fact with the pink , glasses , here 's come and say , okay , just do a second shift .
what , on my job is beautiful ?
that sucks is , even though the pink , glasses is , it looks like everything in a bit of like before .
so something to talk , this is n't beautiful , in it 's obviously not .
the pink , glasses is by the super , for bicycle on driving .
there 's holding them a wonderful to the fly , the else in your land .
but to sonstigem what they do n't .
where is that again , that if we do n't change ?
and indeed , job , the content , our betätigung ?
within the company , outside as more self-sufficient .
it ends maybe in a system where we have that us feel like the mouse .
the mouse up a in this wheel , and runs and runs and there 's now , and eventually , interestingly enough to quickly , this wheel it hits the poor mouse and they go out .
what makes the mouse , but it ?
you know nothing else , they go back in the thing in the hamsterrad .
and again and after year , maybe the movie , every day , that murmeltier you know about perhaps , you know , soft .
that 's beautiful gepolstert here with hay , so it does mean time , because failure and it goes over and again so this field .
and that , what we as funny and feel , probably has the mouse looking at once a concussion , yeah ?
or something needs to umdenkt sdie .
i went many years ago so when i the was about one of students at home .
and suddenly , was , so the street under me , felt it was black ago my eyes and somehow got to ' i stand by .
the next day i went to the doctor , because i thought , what is there on ?
he got me and said , no way that 's physically everything in order .
but how would do with the stressniveau from ?
and i looked in my calendar , to bring that test , and saw , i worked for three weeks , and somehow -- i was also the job .
twenty years in the weiterbildungsbranche and collaborator , the first , in the early on , asking whether we look at night before you can make .
i also thought , what is it actually anyone else is still for jobs ?
and i started , verbring , again other priorities to relate , to look , that i time with my family umzudenken , something good for me '' which i 'm doing .
betätigungsmöglichkeit , whether it 's not a different überleg there in my job , a new of .
i 've begun , the talks at large groups that make me there 's got joy .
i 'll do , sing again , advice and , and also other things , but these talks to be able to , experiences out , the prepare me there 's got joy .
and that was n't always been so .
i was have to recognize that this dauernde stress sick .
and sometimes need this is the the so , umzudenken of me that 's degree from left the hospital was educated , after he 's a heart was he has her , and he starts , too , trainerkollege .
sooner than i said , you leave with some jogging , he has always impressed me belächelt , yes , you with your running and so .
today about it buries itself .
so , with pulsbereich , beautiful slow , in the right walkingstöcken , but eventually we will also in common to go .
what happened ?
the bottom line are we all healthier .
the krankenstandstage go down , but a curve that this transience , is the diseases of mental health .
arbeitsunfälle minus four percent in the time last 10 years , gesamt almost call minus fifty percent , that 's beautiful , that will be less .
rise of psychiatric disorders . & percent .
that 's something , where i think , to be that ?
why is that ?
is the only in austria , so ?
no , also in germany , it 's .
atmungssystem , together , that will all healthier .
that 's so here on the left-hand side to recognize .
so in the mental illness in trouble , plus a hundred percent in the last 10 years , finds a a big german vesicherung out .
the number verschriebenen psychiatric drugs treat it to .
also the cost .
and it 's think about all kinds of official , what we can do with this subject ?
make suggestions or sometimes it into an involuntary hoppalas , like for example here .
so let 's good thing .
and somebody has once said , no alcohol 's also not a solution .
but what is then the solution ?
what is then that , which gives us again , healthy and it and with happiness ?
and that has me the last years busy .
i thought , there 's something like the leistungsglück , it 's something that even though there ?
i 'm so , the job is not that , which gives us ultimativ is fulfilling and happy to do .
there 's many other things that are important , family , health , believe , and so forth .
but the fact is that we the most of our wachzeit in the work on remaking ourselves .
and if we do that , then why not this what do that it 's delight over years and also by anything else .
the ema-prinzip wideg ' i want them heut than one last offer to fix that möcht and to tufu-formel .
these little had no , the communication , hopefully then to realize it .
tufu is for talent and , freedom and environment .
that is , how nutz ' i mean we ?
in the environment , i found that , also with whom ?
what kind of freedom , i here , to do that , what i want to do ?
because it 's the degree of the stresst , the us fremdbestimmung .
the more of them , the more stress .
and what i do that ?
the manifestation .
for these four areas .
and it can everyone for yourself doing .
i had this for me putting yourself doing with a few years and i 'll do this is always again .
can i mean we use ?
in the environment ?
and that is , sometimes i go in a cafe with my laptop , to this is for or a votrag .
the freedom .
what kind of freedom , can i take to bring that do , like me that 's important .
and i do ?
the manifestation .
the last ted u .
and then there 's it again and people , the me explain why that 's not about .
and why that in them much harder is .
then i eventually , like an answer , at this .
who want to find ways .
who did n't , has reasons .
and certainly by the globe in , this can choose because i ways , they do i ways , or i reasons why ?
and they 're in both right .
what do we so with our talents somewhere else ?
each of you has its large schatzkiste you .
that 's too small .
that 's filled with talent , with gold , with all sorts of , with their skills .
what we doing that ?
by the end of questions that we imagine .
or if we 're in the hospital or the end of life .
what i tried to put my talent and shakers ?
the way , who here like it has on schokolade-spezialitäten salzburger , can do afterwards and here 's still access .
now , which we doing with our talent , is so my first question , ends , i hurled myself , through every day .
nutz ' i the good enough ?
and resources .
there was yet another thing with a story .
the i want to tell about salzburg .
and that möcht ' 'you need to college , still do .
this is was the rescue , for the salzburger ago when have five hundred years the enemies came out .
and the enemies realized that this is that well , built was that you ca n't take them could .
thick walls are ways , the raufführen to the fortress , the doors , where , this on .
was uneinnehmbar at .
so we thought , the ways that works , okay if we do n't get in , then we form a belagerungsring .
we let 's no more out and in .
look like for the that there 's purposeful .
the salzburger think it was from long until the day came , where the was almost out it were .
they had only still a stier the was already on the way to think that it to be as the hauptmann , and says , and give me this stier and give me three days .
and okay , stier , you 've worked really , i vertrau you , come , take the hauptmann and help us .
stier goes with the hauptmann way .
suddenly , look down the enemies how about the wall of the fortress is a stier pulled it is led by researcher , from left to right and already in the early .
well , thinking , the ways , a stier , what is that already .
it 's an afternoon .
again will a stier stages , on top of the wall of the fortress , now this is he was , black .
enemies are thinking about is , oh , the still has two stiere , it can still something which may .
the evening i did the scenario and again , this is he knows the stier , the there on and is led .
out for the second day , after the six different nacht-und-nebel-aktion have seen the bottom -- they pulled in a stiere .
because they thought that takes us to long , that we find yourself , is not from .
and then the stier down to the wuschen and salzach the salzburger .
the one , where you had and the process .
that are the stierwascher salzburger .
i like this idea that everything there is , what we need , and that we have anything .
sometimes it with resources , sometimes it 's not much , sometimes it 's little bit .
but also so we can do something .
we have no idea of the power that we have the world every day to reinvent ourselves .
and if you think that could now a good schlusssatz be then you have right .
in the spring from the spring .
the coming .
and we in an know there is the snow will get there 's start the plants , of branches on gebilden to green gebilden seen .
get there are some point out of these blooms of the crop .
there are coming into this very popular strategies that we then and eat .
there 's grain of this grain then we can get ground and staff of baking .
there are there any animals , having the eat .
there 's real people , the then the products just boil it later on food .
and it 's automatically .
but if you think about that perhaps not all that automatically translates everything is then it 's a fear and anxious .
and of course is this threat maybe just very ambiguous and also very theoretically , but just make in the other , the connection of the flower to plant play in a very , big role .
there 's research that the show that up to achtzig percent of our food that certain foods really do n't there was just like if we do n't make bees have happened .
also this sounds so unglaubwürdig , because it that they know for us is and we need bees might also not all that would perceive .
there 's now some time ago also a very interesting movie , more-than-honey , like a topic .
and i recommend you , you look around it 's cumulative .
now , but look forward , we sat on the gentleman schulklassen the universe is just with the bees to work , the in his high school , in teichmann the importance of bees were much power .
that 's he 's a school in überlingen and he 's going to us now some things about his work to tell .
please , mr. teichmann .
yes , good evening .
insulin-resistant , a big , you know , mr. ted-x-bodensee-team and the whole reichert .
that i here with my project , bienen-machen-schule specifically das-fliegende-klassenzimmer contribute something about the lives of bees .
and that also still under a wing of bienenwesen something about a little merkur-eins to tell that makes fun .
because i assume that the most of you hoffnungsloses in these are it would be so tonight is a imkerisch companies you in eighteen minutes in the basics of beekeeping in order to want .
that i do n't , no .
but maybe you get it me , you to convince you to these staatenbildende start to love or some kind of empathy to them to develop and they 're going to engage for this weisheitsvolle genuine , flügelwesen insect in the honey .
my name is thomas seelenpflegebedürftigen , i 'm heilpädagogik years has come with a wonderful woman married , father of five children still not achtundzwanzig and have different ausbildungen and they finished and been working enkelkindtauglich years in the achtundfünfzig with teichmann adolescents and adults .
i 'm a member in bienenhaltung wesensgemäßen and in charity mellifera überlingen imkerverein .
and work now in the werkstattjahr überlingen top of brachenreuthe with our oldest students in camphill-schulgemeinschaft .
we 're working there in the garden , in the agricultural and in the urban beekeeping .
schulklassen is actually a play of raufenden kästner and a pile of erich das-fliegende-klassenzimmer .
our personal flying classroom is more than a make peaceful , a quiet , a steady thing .
and they also to calm .
it 's almost a poetisch-lyrische matter .
and not we 've already the ancient greeks the relationship of honey and so melos wortkunst miel > and the fra < know existed .
and in a wonderful little verse of homer , he describes how the musen apollon his sonnengott to the sleeping guy and then to inspire , that he again , can .
but the munde go there is n't understand myself , but they send her the bees and benetzen now the poet the lips with the wax printer and we crawl in the mouth and back out with him later on the words like honey from the musen flow .
a nice image .
hopefully i can really that tonight is .
yes .
this flying classroom .
i come to the project .
one of schulklasse , this zweiunddreißig the men 's now my students with me to have built for 30 kilometers until bienenschaukästen days in a schaukästen .
in who are schools of us in rengoldshausen the secondary school or in the waldorfschule in the college of owingen or in the realschule überlingen .
a brachenreuthe föhrenbühl or in classrooms we had in partnerschule .
the teacher , the project that accompanied with me in the class , and we 're looking for a particular place for that in a bienenschaukasten .
most of the windows so the children can see during this month .
and all things , so the bees , that then in there are shining through the hose out and again hineinfliegen can .
there is then the window of way we created .
so .
and then the whole thing with me on the bienenstand .
i 'm attracted so that in a bienenschaukasten and finding 'em from a existing waben two bienenvolk out and on you 're now here in these bienenschaukasten in .
it mattered on this on this wabe 're walking so bees .
also important , we have here verdeckelte to , and here to the rim , fresh to be , so fresh eggs .
and then you also a futterkranz , up here .
there is the honey inside .
the need them , when bad weather is and they do n't fly around .
so .
that looks like then off .
then there 's the vorgesehenen here again on it , and begins immediately the transportation , the vorgesehenen , or to the car for plexiglasscheibe place in the school .
, and then something wonderful .
my ladies and gentlemen these bees in there that then in the class of having a sudden a crisis .
their people 's not anymore .
they are lonely .
they find your queen 's not .
and this is the most important task from the schaukasten , when he gave this imker in that he put more important that the queen the old people .
that the so not on these two waben sitting .
and they 're sad , these bees .
they 're starting to roaring .
yes , the imker says , they are roaring .
you hear that .
they sums up almost a bienenvolk higher than if you normally in your oktav with a queen 's coming together .
and now starting a neuorganisation .
my ladies and gentlemen , in a night that they are right now the necessity , a new people to reasons , and the whole thing happened without bildgestaltung , prozessbegleitung , without conferences , without having grown-up , without the opinions and you .
here is the people agree and , then in the first night here a königinnenzelle .
because without the queen going to this came after six weeks , is not exist .
because sommerbienen live just for six weeks .
so .
and in this first night , they 're from one of königinnenzelle a pen out a fertilized egg , and bring that in these waben in .
and because it 's to then a queen going to .
everybody , the kind of you biologie-leistungsfach in the high school , says , how do that go ?
yes , genetically vorbestimmt , there 's all genetically vorbestimmt .
this is true .
, and then something wonderful .
this an egg here , in the königinnenzelle a worker would have been going in the wabe a queen .
the egg has the first three days of the same genetic code , like the walking .
after it gets fed a phalanx of gelée in .
you know that term .
and immediately is changing on this fünfhundertfünfzig on made imagine the genetic code .
the gelée are used by the methylsäure in the methylmarker have changed .
we had that i already heard that , what we eat , that , what of us will .
and in the queen is that really wonderful to experience .
three days so egg , five days made .
and that can graduate students that everything will .
you see that in class .
and then is that cell diktatorisch with a there with and the whole thing happens then also not that , because the people , now when one or because of verdeckelt says , so it going to be , or you back a task force says , you do that now .
no , that happens einmütig .
my ladies and gentlemen , that 's a einmündiger or a einmütiger decision .
and then count the students to eight days of each of my student knows , three five times eight a queen bee does so sechzehn days that the queen in .
and the day , if that then so to happen , the teachers has that we looked in the klingeln bienenbuch the internal alarm in the students in order to five o'clock , yes .
and , the mother , the time , what 's because with you go ?
yes , i got to school . .
yes , because that ?
yes , our founding queen in .
yeah ?
and then are the morning to six in the school .
and then hit the their plexiglasscheibe guy down here , nasen , because they will want , depends on the queen 's now in .
and if you that really see that we can then hear it first thing .
that 's whistling .
so .
still a little bit higher .
and then you have the ammenbienen and cut off the queen going free .
the first what that 's power , they spread her wings , and there are now with their parfüm that people what was have a queen , has another through their , her duftdrüsen , their pheromones .
the people , has now again an identity .
now be three to five days for these queen fed orally .
of the gelée forward , she takes them their ammenbienen in .
the back from the they turn out , from the people , because of this schaukasten .
and after five days going to that 's one of the schaukasten out .
some of thinking now , yes , i 've already seen , such a strauch in bienenschwarm .
wait , and .
what 's completely different .
-- that we let .
these queen the flies by ourselves without schaukasten , but never give out of this eskorte out to about two miles high .
they have surely , seen in her from .
in the begattet and will there 's in a have begattungsakt now drohnensammelplätzen , of seven billion to 12 drones , the male bees .
so , the like in islam where the man different women have here is the queen , the seven billion to 12 men walking .
and the whole thing happening in a wonderful way , in flight .
the drone will come back of begattet these queen , and the queen of it now in this have the mating all this , what you to seed need to for three years eggs to put one .
for the drone is it also a an amazing experience .
if you is finished with the begattungsvorgang you kill them and it has died from the sky .
and then it 's the queen going back and starts , eggs to put one .
there 's always a , two students in the class , the that immediately see .
the also see immediately the queen .
yes .
and then ends up slowly that project in school , because now be the verdeckelt again waben and the queen and the walking is that now to look closely in there .
and then come i one evening , then i 'd go to this schaukasten .
bienenstand that schaukasten , though , and the next morning 'em , i these flugloch with the queen and these bees to me on the verschließ .
and there , here you 're still the queen .
yes .
geschlüpft .
and vague idea of 10 to 12 ammenbienen .
and then comes from this is yes , these two bienenzarge come now here in a waben .
in a full stick , in a 737 falling prey and now can update that people the big and become board .
why bees in the school ?
my ladies and gentlemen the kids that have seen , forget that never more .
yes .
there 's not just like that in this class then the students all the time with the bees are together , but the entire school in this class in .
and the teacher , when he knows , when he 's something can , if it if he was doc , a little prepared the can an era of the other people .
you look , bees and a half ago siebzehntausend years we 've cave paintings , where the people have been the honey and it .
a few months , you get in israel three years old tonröhren found in which the people at the bees .
any human culture has with the bees lived together .
or vice versa , the bees were in every culture .
in china , in india in to , in egypt , in greece in rome .
everywhere , they were doing that .
the human cultures mean , ladies and gentlemen , are passed .
he can a botanik-epoche , a zoologie-epoche hook , he can a genetik-epoche join .
my ladies and gentlemen , you know what kind of flowers , or the trees and the bees befliegen , what they need ?
that they get out there anything you find , now in summer in agriculture .
this out there , that 's a green desert for our bees .
yeah ?
he can find ourselves with students , in the gardening go and there , and plants bees are , the flugloch you mark and look , how long need the now the flugloch up to my flowers ?
how long , they 're on the individuals are ?
and how long , they need to go , they come back .
it can get a geometrie-epoche this right .
how konstruiere i a hexagon ?
yes .
you know , whether that is so that in the bienenvolk the top , the sky is or a flat side , the sky is ?
a look at exactly .
he can a math -- , a meteorologie-epoche join .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , he can with students , even the waben schwänzeltanz on these nobelpreisträchtigen discover .
and then he comes to the question , how could karl from newly neunzehnhundertvierundsiebzig the nobel prize in getting ?
because he thought , it has that the bees that see in the beehive .
but , ladies and gentlemen , in a hive , it 's in .
that 's also a bee 's nothing .
and just the professor waben , the many years in tanzboden , the university , she has the has in würzburg figured out that the bees , there a konstanz creating on individual tautz .
like a fühlern net of the wax in the dadrumstehen a schwänzeltanz create , and now with zweihundertvierzig on their tanzboden afterwards , and the bees , the waben the , pick up with your legs , with their gespanntes .
you see , what these bees in school , do ?
it 's handlungspädagogik the environment , and the children lose your fear of the bees .
and develop an awareness for the bees .
they learn , hinzuhorchen , look , what the bees do .
and they get a be aware of these creatures which basically , just for us human lives .
the bees do with still not a kilo of people in the year .
ago hundertfünfzig years the only way , come to produce .
they 're going to the car into the outside the trees that propolis .
this is a knospenharz , with the with them their people from .
and now you imagine , about , in summer , that are now -- , fünfunddreißig bees on this one narrow set space , in siebzigtausend degrees .
hey , there 's so without end .
no , once in the bees do n't .
because they have in this propolis natural antibiotics .
they collect the pollen , and how things that they can ferment , he 's going to eiweißernährung , a a bienenbrot .
, someone to the car stockluft have parkinson’s disease is , and aromatherapie , imker the can now to a pseudokrupp go and a bronchitis to let by saying , he the atemwegen from the people depend too .
of course , there is a grid before and with atemmaske with a 'nem and so , there’s nothing happens .
yes , and then my ladies and gentlemen , that pollinating the we do that the bees , they also and we have less apples , if the bees do n't fly would sooner or we would like the chinese men 's on the rumklettern apfelbäumen and they sound -- locally .
there 's much more of what 's .
you look at the weißklee , out there on the meadow is the also the growing on the parking , where the cows grazed down .
and there is the bee , catching up their nectar and develop these weißklee .
and now comes the cow , and the weißklee and just , because they fermentierten weißklee pick up , it can digest .
yeah ?
and then runterschlucken you that again and notice , ah , yes , i weißklee fermentierten , ah , i can again käut .
and then there 's milk .
that makes the bee .
yeah ?
and to last , gives the bee keeping us that most valuable , what it on the image of the nature , there .
the honey .
i want to , quickly to the point , inklusion .
my students to be delighted , every year when you these bienenschaukästen build and then , with me together in the schools go .
that 's now not my heut but once i had a student and there was i said in überlingen in school in biologie-hörsaal and said , you , vorrednern do you 've run itself .
and then he says , yes , i k-punkt d-punkt .

thank you .
hello , love her friends in the world .
welcome to talk at my project .
this off my person and my wife .
it 's the struggle for a base of the female genital region .
in my view the greatest crimes of humanity , because it just been five thousand years .
the society against the women with many , six thousand sacrificing a day .
first möcht ' i imagine .
my name is rüdiger , i came from .
there was i konditorei years a fünfundzwanzig run .
they can think that i on the job n't zufriedengestellt .
but i was n't herausgefordet .
and for that i was happy that i fell in the theme auskannte good survival and now been run any could .
for example , this .
with a massive baumstamm about the atlantic ocean of africa , brazil .
on the sail a plea to the car yanomami brazil 's the bankruptcy genocide , the last in indians from the staatspräsidenten , to prevent .
this was a ride , where i more upboat was as submarine , more upboat as uboot .
yet , we were doing these are uniquely suited to the interest in the media to find and even a small person as i could his cause global in the language .
danakil-wüste i figured out with their own all the neunzehnhundertsiebenundsiebzig in ethiopia through .
at a war between a and ethiopia and we were what this killings in there .
and despite all the cruelty , the we 're experiencing , we experienced on the other side of the infinity the hospitality beduinische , the us into muselmanen , to hospitality .
and you can never happened it that we invaded and our two at that you see here , reconnecting with their bodies as living up before us , krallten , and the with said that are my people .
if you get the killing you all you by us through it shoot .
something similar , i was not another culture found .
and then in a young couple years already learned that you are not can reduce on terrorism .
christians , want to do n't be reduced on their terrorism .
for example , the indianer-ausrottung .
the -- that kreuzzüge .
but rather on the true value , how to charity , social responsibility the un-menschenrechtscharta .
these are the values , for the , it 's worthwhile to fight .
after many years after i was once again in this annette been , along with my wife danakil-wüste .
and there we heard from this wahnsinnsverbrechen female genital region .
when i then heard that out of those of the daily unwidersprochen are the rest 're christians and weltreligion ' i thought about how can a andersgläubige like the islam , besides all of this is also still muslimas in the shoes do so let me ?
and the idea was the highest quality of islam to convince the need to sin to understand .
we were looking for these germans organizations that we have n't found .
because we had to then to now we would be completely dialogfähig , of islam is n't durchgeknallt .
you 'd struck me the throat ribbons .
on kurzerhand of which and then we have anraten our own organization started sybase .
and were kind of bedenkenträgern and feiglingen independently .
and now this battle also at all gain can we needed images .
it was a scarcity .
and therefore i moved annette and i go back in this desert to be with hidden camera these pictures to make .
the bad as a bloody pictures that i show you do n't , but i want to doing this drawing out .
girl the age of four weeks to delegates to be at some of their parents and , but , on the earth and you would , the limbs , and you keep them with no , the clitoris and the scheide up with a scheide the stopfnadel to , without , with virtually instruments are no way of hygiene , and the anatomy and the schamlippen other .
what you 've left is an open up from the size of reiskornes .
for the day is now one to 15 minutes .
if you get them do these two weeks .
it destroyed her body and soul , it their dignity .
that was the beginning of the so-called verstümmelung pharaonischen .
in the wedding night let 's on .
the man has to open it .
he still has never a unbekleidete woman seen .
the uncle 's have thought he said , oh , at , there 's no problem .
you 're rubbing your penis with vaseline a and then one you very hard , through .
and if you do n't it says , is not bad .
then take you the knife and cut them on .
this is verstümmelung pharaonische .
and dies a third of the girl .
these you had three months ago , .
shock has the girl his language is lost .
these are the verstümmelungsländer , also some in asia .
the most are which is king .
and know , when we are muslims were asked , why you have that 's done ?
she was the meistgegebene answer , that we need to do that 's in the koran .
nothing 's in the koran , one of the contrary .
everybody believing unfehlbar five times every day in prayer , how one with , the creator , is perfect , bekennt .
but they do n't seem to believe what they there praying .
they imply be , a rumzuschneiden to be the women , has created and why this technology , well as mickriger person having could produce , women pfuscher .
but now we had the images from the first of mine was this sultan .
he zusammenzutrommeln us , his whole clan-führer gestattete to a conference .
there 's hard discussions , for two days .
but we had the minister on our side , the highest scheichs on our side .
and then the great decision , the practice is against all rights , against the religion , we must ban them .
as a lot lately she has the way by this new stammesgesetz signed .
and if you africa and the stammesgepflogenheiten know , you know that , only that has to these people are valid .
and it was being celebrated , and these successes , we had actually , in other countries .
quick example , right there oasen us , the highest spiritually , the großmufti the country on his message that it 's a crime is , on going to write and that now in the gestattete to wear .
for weeks , we were traveling , with your own camels .
a `` we had .
and where we came , we 've just open your ears , open arms and the historical sayings , then i 'd seen .
and when we the place where eventually leaving me to think she said , the great scholar and fünfunddreißig rüdiger , you want to actually now all großmufti countries in ?
so much lifetime will be you did n't give them .
he 's right .
i 'm achtzig and there you have to slow to the thing .
and all , he had an idea .
he said , if it succeeds , the ten allerhöchsten muslims in the world , a table to , and the explain the need to sin , then it 's a sin .
azhar-universität and i flew to one in the annette and -- mosque to do with the vatican the very much .
and on the privataudienz for gum'a quite the eminenz , his großmufti professor , ali theologisches we got a allerhöchsten .
he heard the idea was thrilled , especially , when we found him this notion that we finance this would .
and that we do it 's all over provider , the support us .
and then he said , i 'm going to the conference is not only schirmherrschaft , like we can displace it being asked him , but i 'm going to the moderieren take over .
and that he has done .
over cairo zweitausendsechs at this back in flatterten our government transparent .
international verstümmelung to ban on the gelehrtenkonferenz of the female , and just cut .
under the gum'a the muftis professor , ali schirmherrschaft .
and all these are they come .
a hundred at , but the highest in the world .
in the middle of dänemark-streites of qatar , the man has einreiseverbot in hamburg , and in the rest of europe , he 's the cause of the großscheich because of the cartoons .
so men the life and death not to move .
but also the other .
the left the schirmherr religionsminister , right the al-azhar , my großscheich .
the highest in the world .
about where i naivling me , to a vacuum , and with personally .
and then i eventually they all your surroundings .
it started the conference .
and under our sign at the großmufti from left vorstandstisch from egypt .
the rüdiger großbäcker the sonderbotschafterin egypt , religionsminister of woman was mubarak and al-azhar großscheich , germany .
so much to the topic , of islam is not dialogfähig .
we had also have given by the on their way , verstümmelung , what you women in , with the klarmachten .
and then you for ungeschönt your film , show annette .
reality .
the men had and eyes .
they moved back behind sort of doors just two hours you had decided and a have written , a rechtsgutachten .
the mufti of the cameras , declared , what you decided it has .
and the most important set for , and that was this .
female genital mutilation is a strafbares crimes against the values of islam and it goes .
he , the repercussions all over .
we thought , the job is done had but the bill without our 've done .
because the shame , over the abdomen using the woman , to talk , is stronger remained as any mind .
it 's why we have nachgeschoben .
we have this we have the conference was documented in this so-called `` golden rule book .
a predigtvorlage for the imams start this world .
and because ali schirmherr , the gum'a , it so well , i found , the book , he has it with a , blessed .
it 's going to us from the hands out .
we were in many countries had then at this right , the living on top leaders who .
and you read that with interest in some were so thrilled that you , the book 'd have .
unfortunately , but have the most not the courage to put this , that now also to announce .
over the abdomen using the woman stands to you 're not in the mosque to talk .
just some have the courage to put this .
they 're at least in the universities are gone , on the squares .
and sometimes we have some so it 's found the fact in the mosque about gepredigt , how did here .
and then it goes out of speakers in the frauenabteilungen .
and that are the affected .
the will it spread .
but i 'm going out of time .
it are all drop on a hot rocks , and for that i work , many other strategy , this topic durchzukriegen .
the need to stop .
but my non-plus-ultra-vision that would these .
i want to the great message the highest into the world to announce the birthplace of islam is over here , had the kaaba in mecca .
not so hauptpilgerzeit pilgertag müden , but in the 'nem .
if here four million people come together , men and women verfeindete islamic currents .
then möcht ' i do with all that and the seen on my transparent up there between the mosque minarets it .
how i showed this hey , trained in the fotomontage .
unfortunately i 've not the last saudische , that would be the kooperator king .
but i 'm sure , when he said of erführe he would join .
one thing , to these women to help .
to another firm to conclude the time to show , which the true value of islam , that are constantly going to them .
from terrorists than verbrecherorganisation .
if i do n't that , then schaff ' i might this , what in hamburg , you had .
that at least a lot of it in the busiest mosques in in the world .
and we possibly be transparent and it could .
and may be i do it 's still , that the little girl his daughters , is not real needs to .
then , there has my life so right off .
and i want to calling , every difference , this now heard has seen or has to join .
also not be part is already a mittäterschaft .
we need to the practice in the ton , otherwise have i here from this stage still not decline .
and now i want to you conclude the first draft of my transparentes us , show .
this is my mitstreiterin , my annette .
and that 's in all the world up there in arabic in the name of the gnädigen and all that always have to anticipate .
down there we have it actually , in german .
female genital mutilation is with the koran , and the ethic of islam , incompatible .
it 's gottesanmaßung and one of discrimination of islam .
thank you .
thank you .
so , i 'll start with it , here .
so , we had essenspakete from that you make a refugee in germany .
the neunzehnhundertneunundneunzig pay attention dreiundzwanzigsten have my mother , my brother and i the first time as a package out .
and , it bestialisch .
my mom was completely terrified , because they did n't understand why the us now , eating disorders .
the third day we finally get resolved .
we stood there went to the stuff again we then came a dosengemüse wife and it that just fiercely against albanische from .
they tried to us to explain , that you can eat .
this is n't do .
that tastes like even very good .
it 's cheese .
my mother was dragging the eyebrows up and we were laughing .
cheese .
in my homeland , we have that goat but the has not so vergammelt smell .
i 'm sechsundzwanzig kurban and suli years old .
fifteen years when i have to my mother and my brother of china , germany had fled .
this kind of the möcht today i tell .
but importantly , it 's going to me about trying to the people that these the potential to have and to a success did .
but first , i want them , where i just come from .
i 'm uigurin .
for are a little volksminderheit , in the northwest of china life .
and this region is kind of the chinese that autonomous area xinjian called .
it 's about fünftausendsechshundert miles from germany away .
in china to live in 10 million , but in munich is the largest uigurische community of china .
and these their lives so here because we 're in china under constant human suffering badly need to .
hundreds of chinese were extra uigurien relocated , so we in our own home to a minority are .
our own native language , uigurisch was taken from the education system eliminated .
in schools and in university will only still in chinese were taught .
and our religion can we also do n't act .
the to lose their culture and identity .
and if someone with this is and for the rights of their in risk for a large sentences from or even after death .
that was also , the reason why my parents , for you 've decided , with us kids to escape .
that was neunzehnhundertneunundneunzig and i was at 11 years old .
the photo is , just before our escape .
we had not enough money , so , my father had insulin-resistant , it .
i erinner me , many people , the us in the run have helped .
i erinner me , many images .
i schlepper me , but first , schleppern our mischa erinner .
i just know it right in me , if i my eyes zumache .
he was big had a lederjacke , over and we met him with his little bunny put on a parking lot .
the first rate was to hand .
i know that lots of a negative image of schleppern have that the only do business plan to refugees abuse , and how do n't need for the fates are interested .
but i want to say i want to him as schlepper call , not as fluchthelfer .
because mischa think that has conducted months of hysterical .
he stood the airport in grenzkontrolle on a aussichtsbrücke and has to the last end with , whether we also really sure through the bischkek came out .
airport in frankfurt we came on , and i know , as my mother of have to me she goes out of the airport .
turns over .
until we are out .
because i had bought it in my hand a pass and there was also my photo , but there was a total stranger whose name , firusa .
i had as grenzkontrolle through the firusa .
and i zollbeamten me , 'nen erinner the me the he had my travels along in the hand .
silence .
and sweat .
a long view .
we finally durchgewunken .
in munich erinner ' i a lot of the first responders , we on the kind of very strongly supported .
i flüchtlingsheim me , the albanische woman , the with us in erinner used by .
in a baracken with four baracken per flüchtlingsheim of families .
at least for children .
a gemeinschaftsbad and a kitchen .
it had a stranger whose faces .
and many different languages .
and we did n't have privacy .
my mother , my brother and i had to us a zwölf-quadratmeter-zimmer share .
there was being eaten , slept and done homework .
friends were having now not to visit me because i verheimlichte , where we were .
just my übergangsklasse the klassenleiterin in the high knew .
they knew my story and with me very and they took care , is to me .
for example , they took me to sportgymnastik rhythmische what i now , is not do .
but it helped me also really , in german people were to meet .
i spent my whole time in asylbewerberheim .
that was for my mother 's not easy .
alone with us to kids , without your husband and always in the uncertainty because we had just one -- and then we want to be .
i erinner me that i , really aggressive was to the time .
it 's me also slightly embarrassing , this now here 's all to tell , but now i have to just to my history .
i was very aggressive and was able to me in school , bad way to focus .
the 1980s brought us , to do erziehungshilfe where we the first time to normal young kids in touch were coming .
with a normal my darlin ' i kids , the not in a asylbewerberheim to live in fact , to .
i feriencamps me also going to the caritas-mitarbeiterinnen the me and my brother . to get or erinner to have .
just so we bit out .
i mitarbeiterinnen me also , several ehrenamtliche erinner the with us done homework , because our parents definitely not going to praise .
or the have with us just painting .
we 've always very happy .
i know , how we always in the fence line up and waited until these people came , because , somehow mysteriously going to strangers who were looking for us time , and that was us back as important .
after two years , finally got my father , germany .
the problem was but that he 's directly from niedersachsen bayern or was because it in munich , is no more for him there .
i abschiebung me , the very , who 's the it has managed , my father now , the erinner to china to protect us they made it even notice that he we had in munich to me .
i asylbewerberheim me to that time where i really then , really glad that was because after six years erinner allowed to do we finally in a standard apartment .
we got a aufenthaltsgenehmigung for three years and we had finally one own apartment , with a own , and one of your kitchen .
and i had actually a room .
it was a very small and i did n't have desk in , but it was good , i could my door that .
and i erinner me that i have the time , very well used , but i had yet the college , without a research has left .
i looked for me really not a perspective .
there was a nachholen , the me in asylbewerberheim always been supported and it , still going on the idea that i was about the second was my degrees ehrenamtliche can .
first quali then the hauptschulabschluss .
i thank the teacher , the really , i thought bruises and i was really not just to the time , i actually made it to middle level .
after i came to imal .
and before i , bunt-kickt-gut i played the way with my best friend straßenfußball imal .
straßenfußballs is an organization or a project of the organized bunt-kickt-gut .
but i was no good bunt-kickt-gut that i also only done because we 're going through fußballerin a place where we simply could go .
we had a valve matter , which means we our aggression , they could .
and the ladder of bunt-kickt-gut helped us somehow we did that time with him tell us could and he went to us and could tell us in all ask somehow help .
and then i came to international-munich-art-lab , imal .
and that 's a project , where young people without a closing the opportunity to get out , that 's artistic weiterzubilden .
that has to me really very well done , and i 've begun , art is something which i was also slightly runterbringt .
by bunt-kickt-gut and the connect to bunt-kickt-gut came a filmmaker , on us .
he made the movie draußen-bleiben over the lives of my friends and me .
and the movie of awards .
we realized that the people , for our story was interested .
he was a very special feeling , because we it 's still never had experienced that people us to have .
and that was so a moment , where i thought , okay .
i do n't want more do .
i want something comes from my life make .
a collaborator of kammerspielen , a münchener for refugees and it took me on the idea , to a jugendgruppe of the beratungsstelle refugio to tune .
but because i said in the like buildings were totally enveloped me that had i ended up to be held in fluchten for a play and the title is casting one to four .
so i was just right .
i was playing with .
and the great thing is , after a performance of two editors in the bayrischen come on me down .
and i had asked , whether i interest should have just own radiobeiträge to make .
i thought , super , it .
clearly , i do with .
and i made for the radio program civis-medienpreis from , pulse mitspielte and one of my vital contributions of a play win-place-show , in the i also ourselves radiobeiträge was for the european on-drei-radio nominated vice versa .
and i 've got it also actually won .
this has been studying , i do the same for vodafone-stiftung and film and stipendiatin already the third year , and i 'm dokumentarfilmregie the fernsehn .
and that everything would be for me not been possible if not one or organizations like bunt-kickt or projects like refugio well , for me have happened .
they have to me that they have to me open , they have to me ways i’ve shown , as i my place in the society me at head-banging their skills .
and with it was -- i now for them .
each of you has the possibility , people like to help me second chance to get and their lives or their place in the society to find .
because , the people , in every day come have a hundred refugees , and and each of you 're with hope and each of you has a huge potential .
they have it with great determination to many terrible , but behind , to them .
and with this determination , you could really big for profit for germany and for every single one of us as well .
and i could actually a thousand critical things to talk about what you can do , but because i do n't enough . time 've even though there is , a minute by its , i showed you a qr-code brought .
it out they now your appendix out they ca n't tell me tell that you , no code it can .
then scan them the code and then they come on the side of bunt-kickt-gut with many possibilities , what they have no way can do .
and that would take us very good help .
i thank me now , for their engagement and we look out hope .
and then scan them the code using .
i just know it .
many have the mobile phone n't even in the hand .
you are so to become , or what ?
okay .
thank you .

of you have to stop the most is then you have to make the gärungsprozess out of it .
yes .
thank you for listening .
you were great .
thank you , ladies and gentlemen .
let me tell you all the same with a ketzerischen question to begin .
why do you altersforschung at all do ?
i think , everybody , the tax money out it should ask , whether it 's at least some potentially the society which give back .
the answer is clear .
we know now that the life expectancy at the birth just to about determiniert percent of genetically fünfundzwanzig is .
that means that 's kind of environmental impacts , alterungsprozesse give the impact on ernährungsregimes have .
why we know yet still so little ?
why we will be equivalent of of ernährungsbereich of messages from sinnverwirrenden the workforce , to entry part of each other ?
remember the all across in fifteen years seemed the guilty found .
it was fat .
you thought , wondering if you fat from the food style , will we all have and be healthy old .
what the low-fat-produkten of absurden kilometerlangen on with different generierung in america , it has led and what does n't touch it has changed that the americans every year that has become aware .
then you have said , ah , no .
but not the fat .
it are the carbs .
then what to atkins-diet like the low-carb-diet the paleo-diet , the verirrungen and so on has led .
it becomes so again and a new gehetzt a village diätetische .
where the whole verirrungen ?
well , the reason is , for my taste , for part at that we through hochstilisieren fragwürdige to find yourself to the wisdom journalistisch .
example in for a anekdotischen alone is here .
the point you know of all .
neunzehnhundertachtundsechzig published a lot there magazine a new thing .
the top todeskandidaten the prominentesten ten for this is next year .
and with was seven years , on number one on .
then the newspaper .
or this lady here .
jean calmet .
the oldest human beings , that ever attempted on the earth has lived .
hundertzweiundzwanzig years old .
i know , there 's somewhere people that might argue , they are six hundred , but just your geburtsurkunde n't find .
jean hundertzweiundzwanzig is actually calmet become .
and it stopped with vollends on to smoke started -- but with hundertzwanzig again , then finally , with hundertachtzehn hundertsiebzehn the path of the virtue to follow and stop to smoke .
with hundertzweiundzwanzig is then they died .
what that tell us ?
not that , cigarettes , healthy .
but it tells us that , aging , very complicated is and that we understand how it 's really need we need to give up systems and we need to simple questions .
a very simple question and a very simple issue that , the in different countries fighting is women are older than men .
what is that ?
we know it now .
now this is the testosterone up at the nebenhoden now , which in the male sexualhormon produced by 2027 .
and there 's kastrierte is very simple evidence for 'nen men are so just as old women .
you can now everybody for themselves , and think if that 's a anti-aging-weg gangbarer is .
austria 's a free land .
but it , but also been a good tips , not afraid .
we should we 've got out with very much to confuse this .
sounds complicated , but this is simply , as usual fragetechniken to illustrate .
there 's so somebody a hundertjährige grandma , and asks , what you have -- because so different done or different from eating that they do that old become are ?
ah .
the she has every day , cigarettes , .
this is probably the secret of their ages , right ?
and have the ten cigarettes , maybe just not big .
or but they have data and the she 'd love without the ten cigarettes , even older .
even statistics are not always potent .
there for example , a very hard , that shows that people , the töpferkurse in the photographs to get older than people , the n't do this .
do .
is out .
what 's the college , tonerde toskanischen ?
no .
it is is that the people just enough money in the pocket have to think , to her age and the altersassoziierten diseases to take care .
but if i had a group of animals a ursächlichen to forage maybe give and this group with 20 percent live longer than a group received the zusatz 's actually not get has , but otherwise the exact same way that was then i actually a zusatz factor in the diet affected .
and actually are these attempts have been done .
to tell you , the alterscommunity is very i was explaining but even when i do with my enemies agree -- is , as fast during the life is going up .
and this works for the different organisms .
for example , in bacteria .
you see here a lebensspannkurve of bacteria .
if we the fast , in the gestrichelten line showing then life that were much longer .
the same thing for hefen , : flying over mice and recently was only about two years in the u.s. shown that it even for a monkey is true .
let 's not about , skinny .
it works like , liebhabern the fat check your kitchen .
and that 's a another experiment , what in the united states was taken .
what you did here ?
you has a käsestücke , and has the one which is mac-donalds-artige to , a high-fat-diet diet , where you so so many mausgruppe this day and night .
and who to wonder , the mice are , that had become sick and have a , purple leberwerte of out and bad fettleber .
now , you get a parallel käsestücke , and that has the exactly the same number of the mausgruppe fed just that in a pause it was .
the have to do n't eat the ability to , for you have at twice as much eating .
and these fettleber now is not and healthy and they also has no mausgruppe .
even though , both of mice isokalorisch feed itself .
both have a lot eaten .
the a sick and the other healthy .
so what happens , i mean ?
it becomes a process called the cellular autophagie or selbstreinigung it on .
know , when they were organisms , or nerve cells replicating food taken away then she catches the organism , these ingredients in the cell or those compounds our lives to that spawned again energy to make .
that makes sense .
and that looks like this .
they can see , in the cell , akkumuliert mainly to junk , the episcopal diocese during the ages müllsäcke .
the other then with the stomach and examine the be kleingehackt and the cell as energy back available to put them .
it be a sort of the the age accumulate in .
this is quite the molecular fastende the seelenreinigung , or the katharsis of the korrelat often tell .
so , to make it up as fast is going up the lives in these different organisms .
and it 's probably , to know that 's also in people work .
and we learn from this is that it 's actually not like in portiönchen about every small hüngerchen the day with two decades diät-zeitschriften fight .
no .
but , they should say , if you 're hungry , ah , maybe is under the autophagie it on .
welcome them their hunger strike like a friend .
and that makes also evolutionsbiologisch sense .
while neunundneunzig point had nine nine percent of the human history has the person , what did , when he got hungry ?
alright , he 's has gone .
we go out regularly , the fridge for hunting , if we 're hungry .
and that 's safe against the biology .
now we know , and that 's already in the bible , in einundvierzig chapter sechsundzwanzig verse matthäus , the mind is going , but the meat is weak .
that , looking for us very different from .
here , kind of brueghel in a medieval cities , showing .
the three guys here 's hear well , the food all the day , let , too .
and that 's kind of the actual wunschvorstellung .
we 've been so on the , looking for we did that need to answer the fastens but despite the organism is eating .
so that could for people be interesting , whose einzulegen not enough just fastenpausen gelegentliche willensstärke .
and it could we may be a congregation of the hardest wegkreuzungen of life preserve .
the question is so we can the selbstverdau , the autophagie , the cellular fasten-antwort turn , although you eat ?
and we have a hundred , of the thousand get constantly on , natural substances .
we 've actually , a found that means spermidin .
spermidin is a solid substance , the in all , naturally does the but also in all , during the means less will .
in the skin is it the prononciertesten .
fünfundzwanzigjährige people have been much less spermidin in the skin as dreißigjährige .
and if we now spermidin on human cells there , for instance , then you see that works .
this is a one cell division here .
is the aufräumt , the nucleus , we give akkumuliert on it , and we see many thousands of this little müllkörbe in the cell that computer watched the junk , the episcopal diocese during the ages spermidin , zellkörper .
gefastete cells that would it for a look like this .
and this works in these different organisms .
here for example , shown in one fliegenmuskelfilet .
so we have a i found that the molecular autophagie turn the fasten-antwort .
life because the organisms in that i also more .
and the answer is again , you see here a typical fliegenpopulation of a überlebenskurve .
it are simple drosophila-fruchtfliegen .
after achtzig days are the all dead , after the house for days is about half the dead .
know , when we spermidin the water there , here in to be the animals grow older and surviving better .
we also know that human cells that we of 's going on spermidin have in culture about three times as long survive , if we do you with gezapft put themselves .
and the latest research , too close that even the lives of all over mice down through spermidin they will .
and is not just the life , it 's also the gesundheitsspanne .
these mice are clearly immunkompetenter .
so .
now they want to say , all know , where is spermidin ago ?
how the name says , it 's in the sperm being discovered was educated , you get it in a very high concentrations ago .
but i can they did , also in spermidin fresh green and so cheese , and a product of nattou about , what in japan ansehung afforded , that 's so we fermentierten 's very much weizenkeimen ago .
we 've then , when neurodegeneration aufräumt helps , by it the junk alterungsprozesse it do then we might also spermidin ?
they have to which is to know , the common point of all akkumuliert diseases is that during the ages proteinschrott in the brain neurodegenerativen .
and we have in fact , those experiments done .
they 're going to wonder , we have the flies have done .
flies to see , but somehow , if you to age .
they have more proteinschrott in the brain , if you to age .
and the molecular mechanisms that for memory of governments are are very much like the people .
now you ask , yet , how to the devil has the fellow the memory of flies have measured ?
this is the experiment , what we share with his one of college berlin who did .
they take a fruit flies and to declare that 's a give workshops where one of the , they love .
zwetschge .
and let the in this zwetschgenduft now .
then they take the same fly , give them in the next chamber , and give them kirsch other , the , they love , which is 'nen .
we let them the dazugeben enjoy , while they but a zuckerbelohnung kirschduft .
in classic belohnungsversuch .
then take them back the same fly , do the here in .
the driving this degree in the way down , there you the .
and if you down here , which are , give them from the one side kirschduft and of other side zwetschgenduft .
where you go in the all ?
right .
the cherry factory .
except the two here .
these are the depperten .
or , we say , they have character .
i love my schnöde and i let me not by this is a zwetschge reward corrupt .
okay .
but this is a form of character , the older , growing .
not just switched to fly .
and we could actually the jugendliches the fly through juveniles on a spermidin-fütterung , on a erinnerungsfähigkeit , and again .
and the proteinaggregate , the in the brain were , were back the ground .
that is , altersassoziierte does n't just aging , but also spermidin diseases , that .
and that 's important , because we want the gesundheitsspanne not the life that extend .
it does n't make sense , the era of agonie to extend .
and i want to you do n't let them , without them , a few practical tips to give we we have a younger .
well , gelegentliches fast .
it 's not to you that weight or so .
there 's by now in austria , a group of zwanzigtausend people , the one day , eating and one day n't eat .
this is the which is zehn-in-zwei-community under the leadership from university has given and and change .
and the keep the very good pilot .
that is , it 's praktikabel .
one carve them zuckerschocks .
it 's not to do n't solve complex than this is why does n't even dangerous . .
it 's really to take candy .
you know now , that zuckerschocks sufficiently to get diabetes in , even then if you have are .
and you know that sugar the growth of tumors accelerate through .
here you can wurmpopulation , the question , the ages .
after 30 days are the all dead .
so very low doses of glucose .
to join a progeriatrischen effect to create .
there 's just a example , this works in almost all of organisms that .
you eat regular , fruits and vegetables .
one carve them the gift of much to vitamintabletten or from vitamintabletten at all .
you know now that vitamin-e-supplementationen -- and vitamin-a cancer .
this is not under conditions for them vitamin d .
we are there might have degrees ' in winter a vitamin-d-mangel-gebiet , because vitamin d is driven by sunlight on the skin is building .
some that you least three times per week , a half hour of sports , that 's completely trivial .
now despite the original epidemologisch examples of cost you anekdotischen 10 to fifteen years lifetime .
do , they were times the eternal online-seins occasionally the quiet .
so the impact of praying , and blood pressure on the life is to back .
because of lives almost as long as women .
nichttrinker , alkoholtrinker moderate , live longer than alkoholtrinker .
biertrinker live longer than weintrinker .
but nichttrinker life , still no longer than biertrinker .
just nichttrinker die , sooner than schnapstrinker .
what is that ?
the people assume that has what with some reason we to do .
it , no way , that 's very simple .
if now here 's a alkoholhaltigen the window is then our in-group , i the with 'ner fettfleck solution way .
and what that 's probably in her around .
rausgelöst scaling , cholesterinplagues and so what , are used by drinking alcohol , there fettartige .
why has no alcohol , is a kardioprotektive effect .
a permanent . have or a family , it 's associated with .
they should not a lot of the busiest streets live .
now you think that are in feinstaub .
that has but with feinstaub n't have to do .
it goes from .
they can measure the closer to put a lot of the busiest streets have that , the more stresshormone he has been in the blood .
and that also , when he says , i was doing , they undoubtedly has gotten used .
i can already well to sleep and the sound and i do n't like .
not true .
he has yet more stresshormone in the blood and that 's bad .
you should we 're going to because of hautschäden course .
we know now , that knoblauch very good is corrosive effects .
all , it can make the need to lower .
and we also know that i and knoblauch mice and protect .
knew that by our grandmothers will also the us with traktiert and so on zwiebelsud have .
it may not without any sense .
several different studies show that dark chocolate , dementia protektiv can .
and just recently 's a study with that has shown that a half the panel of dark chocolate a day , the dreißigjährigen of sechzigjährigen on the level of erinnerungsfähigkeit bring skills .
similar to you of coffee there 's the -- but thinner .
there 's trials , having the show , there 's studies that do n't that show .
what 's clear , is that coffee against juvenile diabetes protektiv the targets and their metabolic performance better .
and coffee is actually also a good kroemer because he solves autophagie from , how we share with 'll fastenhelfer from paris to show you could .
a very nice and intricate study in the hundred thousand people fifteen years , they were have shown that people that every day a handful of you eat their mortalitätswahrscheinlichkeit twenty percent mortality down .
this is a huge value for a epidemologische study .
and this is for , who , of , walnüsse , pinienkerne , macadamia , haselnüsse .
but not for the peanuts the botanically in fact , beans .
the give just assume , by , you want you call , okay ?
that are , but actually beans .
so for this is not .
the next thing is a little bit .
one carve them the shot of to a lot of animal protein , so of meat and dairy , but only , if you between fünfundsechzig and fünfundvierzig years old .
a very beautiful new study shows that you , if you in this time to a lot of animal protein to take you 'll have krebrisiko so strong , increase , as if you a strong smokers , which are .
this is not for the time afterwards , where animal proteins are good and it 's true of course not to get kids or a juvenile , the animal protein and it 's not for pregnant and the ones that it will want .
generally , do you nahrungsdogmatismus .
, whatever they do , they explained that knew already friedrich nietzsche along , who has said the important to say , the spottlust , the joyful into the seitensprung are signs of the health .
everything there heard in the pathology labs .
this is the gentleman hundertacht caruso the has about , after this regime that lived and he 's salvatore years old .
it out of my home nachbardorf from the calabrien , is never get sick .
and he 's hear very good .
he 's just might not hundertjährige 'm not an anecdote on , but it lives in a hotspot , where it too many of paradigmatischer there .
he has about the ernährungsvorschriften followed that i do you today 've said .
we should look at all the geschilderten experiments , a important fact , not only overlook .
which is that the types of it me in a biological limits but it seems to be , and so , a -- .
you fatalsten the old people less to and that could one of the traut wrong with our culture .
weltliteratur wrote the greatest on the dostojewsky a year ago , his death .
the brothers came up .
a piece that somewhere , a critic , are the adolescents at lobten .
i thank you for your attention .
i want to begin with a question that i want them .
a question , where nobody wants to step up , because the is a little one is a lot of you is you ?
the output is very low .
and less than i thought .
it has but probably reasons that they 're not reported , even the people that for critical , because it bejahen would .
many people confuse solitude and loneliness and think that would be synonyme .
and what is not liking that the case .
'll see more loneliness is actually more of a phenomenon , among humans than just straightforward .
maybe it also is that they 're not reported , because the question here 's a matter is .
like to be lonely , or is you do you ?
you can you feel , without feeling lonely .
and you can you 'll be a bit , in the moment you to feel .
one has also much embarrassment -- to do .
also that will be some now here from , have to loneliness to bekennen .
one in shame and it’s embarrassment in loneliness .
one takes time .
also , for that will say , here nobody who have in the few seconds , which i do you 've given .
one takes müßiggang .
one takes the time to me , yours at all aware enough to be .
and loneliness need also practice , to talk about to witness .
and this exercise has to have we do n't .
we have neither the language , we have any sign for us to recognize when we are lonely ?
there 's one two grundhaltungen , which way , i am .
the one part of humanity 's said , you is from beginning , lonely .
of the birth to the cell death is actually you just kinda lonely .
there 's a few moments in life where you that überdecken can .
these people go then often to ted-konferenzen and then , it all day .
i have no time , is so you lieblingsmantra .
and then there 's people might be less in our country , the say , everything is with everything connected .
that i think there 's not actually , so , i is just a piece of one big universe .
and there 's the great group , to the i also about the time so , so thinking .
the thinking , okay , today i am feeling lonely and the next day , oh , it depends on all got together .
if we , it’s loneliness to think of us , the very large loneliness is a a .
the one of the dying , the one of the person on an icu .
but about these einsamkeiten , about these big möcht einsamkeiten today i do n't talk , but i want to talk about the small , about that are the einsamkeiten , where it’s loneliness to us also in this is a theater , we can .
i want to also do n't talk about burden and alleinseins the wonnen .
it’s loneliness is in other to us , not hard loneliness to with us to dahingegen already .
the photographer and -- has in the break a few pictures made that i want to show you .
how easy it 's always matters , other loneliness to .
and we know all not , whether these people really in this moment you felt .
but who knows it 's not , the moment on this quasseln event , where you think , all talking together , just to itself is something lost in the corner and has n't want to 'ner .
this sudden aufbrechende loneliness to know , and safe here all .
may have some they also now have ever experienced .
what you do you put that cell phone out very often say , is that could you today , very good at this is of doing that rumdaddeln on the mobile also an escape , the great .
and visible , if you on that you look .
what we now this is n't do .
yes , and then there 's the one , the types of them is the one of erwartungsvollen on 'ner stage hundreds of redners faces in front of and you even something that rely on in the hope that you can not forget .
these are the einsamkeiten that you make the outside of looks .
that we need to people to it .
but i 'm sure , there 's also people in the room the workforce , from birth , you feel the entire life for so who have , by showing you have tried , this one of wegzudrücken , wanted to distract yourself .
and there 's in this room make sure we also people that are feeling lonely , because they 're on a different people to give up to disclose whether it 's because of the death or because of a separation .
there 's using it also not something that still so many people , also people , which they 're connected to hang around you are they 're feeling lonely .
and there 's people , the have the connections to , being lost no contact more to himself , and are so you .
i nenn that the digital loneliness .
and sit in the from loneliness .
the from loneliness is us familiar .
that are people are moments after their opinion , there 's no , social contact .
also that 's always be relatively .
there 's not an official number , does n't number , whenever somebody that grow human contact , when do n't .
we cut down there , the old people .
it 's the analog form of loneliness .
since we but all in cities to be connected with many people at facebook , or using twitter or facebook is this digital loneliness and bigger .
you can with hundreds of people connected to be disbelief , with a single human being connected to life .
is it in the analog loneliness to the quantity of human relationships , the missing is it in the digital and loneliness to the quality of relationships .
the two forms of loneliness to be very often do the ausgespielt .
that 's because it 's also that the from loneliness is a little grew in .
whereas the digital loneliness to think , suitable for lifestyle-magazinen and columns in glossen .
it 's kind of data point that the digital one in the future , you may gain is when the possibilities , to connect to be bigger .
i do n't know , whether you in 20 years that feeling that the our departure from loneliness is very similar to be going to say , and loneliness is .
or whether you then a new term .
but that are also , problems of the successional generation .
almost more than the loneliness to itself is the fear of loneliness and from this fear of loneliness that are people gained some work to be ready .
um-nicht-allein-zu-sein , the big chanson , also a grundeinsamer person has a wonderful schlagersängerin written dalida .
in that describes it , what people do everything , to not alone .
they build cathedrals , they have kids , that then again you 're and alone .
but that allerbanalste has n't they named after the fear of loneliness to kick out , which is spending money .
in go .
things that 's favor .
both the process over the one , because it at least in a contact in such as the objects themselves that you make acquired by .
only problem is that it 's very briefly , help and the speech , this kind of those potions against the loneliness .
so we need to again and new things buy us connecten .
i ' time the advertising for a a männliches panties label seen .
and the abschauend werbten of phone communication with the slogan of of it .
what the panties has to do , you know that 's not , but apparently you can also that .
one has nothing with the great to do loneliness to find people like that instead .
kästner erich has a wonderful poem written , and there is a verse but in the worst is that it’s loneliness to meet .
hand on the heart , who knows that 's not ?
in a relationship to or the or the others got to see and suddenly there alone to feel , `` you to feel and the to do so , who 's this person , i mean ?
i do with the do something to do ?
a study this says that the most women around the world , married , with kids , feel .
this missing , because i 'd already , is not know , if i was the study found myself 've invented so often i they told .
but is also now whatever it because at least in studies , whatever is and the response always the same is that people who , i 'm going .
that it intuitively so completely obvious thing is , almost make a banalität .
it’s loneliness to have is any given too familiar and yet we talk not about them .
so that would like that little bit about the more sex .
this is also has probably already seen .
while you zugange is a sudden , to think , what do i here , i mean ?
who is this person in my bed , i mean ?
this is also a form of loneliness that does n't necessarily have to do something must have with the quality of the sexual are .
nothing to do have to start with the quality of relationship .
it 's just always there .
we speak only do n't about them , because we do n't you look at .
we speak only do n't about them in the workforce .
in the workforce is that it’s loneliness is also präsenter than we think .
i was in order on this anzugträgern kongresszentrum and watching a group of five 'nem , , i should be three people carrying suit and two people carrying costume either .
the two men have a conversation , the two women in -- 've entertained .
and in between what was something sektglas , something ungelenk with the schlaksig in the hand of our own intern .
i think , i have to you the scene , does n't do with you do that from loneliness that everybody 's also time in his the fabric has experienced again wachrufen can .
it 's the one of the berufseinstiegs .
it 's but also the one of the berufswechsels .
we all know the unorten or i see , in this may also some of their lives small motor cortex , anzugträger .
in konferenzsälen , in flughafenlobbys in the hotels , in that for the often do n't know more , who they 're actually , what they do .
where they are , where you wake up .
also that 's a form of loneliness , over the not talking about how will .
just heard it also machtinstrument , like it’s loneliness than erklärlich be abused .
here is here for insulation .
me has to have a unternehmensberater told that he 'd been gone from a client , and the has said , it 's what has happened , you can do it you to do n't imagine .
a vorstandskollege was alone in the lunchroom .
so he has to itself to abschuss this guy .
and two months later , he 's also on .
the one never comes from that .
it 's always in connection with other feelings .
it has beautiful siblings and she did you 've got siblings .
the ugly siblings know what we all .
fear , sadness in despair and the shame .
but we should also the beautiful 's not forget .
the freedom of the proud of the desire that überwältigtsein .
so my plea for you look around the loneliness .
and goes in life like the tide detergent and floods occur .
let them to and let them , not from her .
because there 's still something much worse than the loneliness and this is the emptiness that may decide , the one comes when you do n't even more .
it’s loneliness is part of life .
since i so hard about one time thinking , have to me two things change .
one thing , in my friends the regiere i do n't even more like a autocratic rulers of since i realized that i only then always somebody who 've why it actually , not in because i was thinking maybe i 'm losing the people , maybe it ' i lonely .
i did this is it since we know , since i the one in my life and people come and go to them .
this is exactly it with the found that you make it does .
also there i am open code .
people come and go to let them , you , is not immediately to and , whether it from an encounter a friendship , with a partnership to could .
as a child , i found my parents an embarrassing .
the ca n't gartenzaun that without with somebody a conversation with anybody .
whether in the metzgerei or in the economy .
every time led to get it from talking .
as a child , i found that as i 'm embarrassed .
as young adult and i eventually they 're incredibly beneidet that 's to this openness to have .
but first since i even so with the more engaged , you get it me at least , and go back to me also found that way to open .
you see you be willing to do for the next occurs .
thank you .
yes , thank you .
i picked up here three .
a einhunderteuroschein a zweihunderteuroschein and a fünfhunderteuroschein .
and now that i want you what if it even have access in which they would you take ?
the most appalling , for the fünfhunderteuroschein decide .
and that 's a damn good idea .
and why ?
because we do with the least of effort into the largest negative effect in pursuit .
in health we doing this kind of different .
because we let the activity with the largest negative effect disappears completely other than eight and decide us for other strategy .
we decide us for example , for the einhunderteuroschein and the is for sports .
big gesundheitseffekte but big effort .
for me why not so valuable .
or we decide us momentarily , zweihunderteuroschein .
the is for diet .
also very large gesundheitseffekte and yet , very big effort .
for me why we 've also not so valuable .
and i want to you today about how they do with the least of effort into the biggest gesundheitseffekte in pursuit .
if you take risks , prevention and health of busy , you come to a subject does n't go around .
and the issue is overweight .
and the subject of this was in germany long time not an issue , so about until in the siebzigerjahre .
and then went from the number of people in germany .
and i asked me , what was there on in the siebzigerjahren ?
why did n't that it suddenly , the sky ?
and then i research and i 'm also has become .
because it was right in years neunzehnhundertachtundsechzig .
what was there ?
there was aerobic , germany .
and we are over and that ?
and i watched .
neunzehnhundertsiebenundsiebzig comes for germany .
and this is going up .
and this back in 20,000 take the curve , right , the journey on .
and what 's rule , germany ?
hlx and isdn and zumba and rumba , and how do all this means .
and we are over and that ?
well , then i was one , and one this .
because it was clear .
sports is thick .
and of course be ' i 'm not here today , to give you say that some sport , power .
because that 's not true .
but one thing we 've now let 's all of aid .
the tide of always wanted to talk about -- and fitnessmethoden has not to run by that we are thinner and be healthier .
what it 's so then ?
the diet ?
and also there 's a very good study from the united states .
also the have the problem with obesity .
and they have in the low-fat-produkte neunzigerjahren introduced .
and then they wanted to briefly , i mean , see what happened there are really ?
and they 've seen , the people , actually less fat on but the people take it also , fewer calories to be , but always on .
and that was paradox .
and so they have it america-paradox called .
we can you explain that ?
because you get to the body as a power imagine .
because we have here 's a big verbrennungsglocke .
and on the one side of it 's a förderband , because they do we all the coals on that might be here you .
and here is the energy do when electricity .
if we now , more up here in to give in our power than we 're going on the other side of staut , the energy at the power and it makes bang .
the human body does not equal to bang .
the can the energy , put it .
and it changes in the form of fat .
our greatest and energiespeicher wichtigster .
what happens , if we are fewer such as we 've heard , energy staut and yet reingeben here the energy then makes it just a conclusion to .
the abgabeseite , there has dramatically reduce .
here 's no life more than it .
we 're yes , to mobile .
and this is this happens .
our grandparents are neunzehnhundertzehn still two miles to a fluke .
and we come today . once on a to two miles and they 're the positive estimates .
there 's studies , the report from five -- until siebenhundert meters .
i plastischer you that still something möcht with my friend mike , telling .
give you show me degrees ' the chair ?
mike , you 're likely degrees ' time ?
mike 's an american .
he 's too shy , he will not talk too much .
and he was back in this trial and sitting now here .
he 's this is the hot-dog-light , the cowboy-hut karohemd and it has a cowboy-stiefel in the hand .
and mike eating more , and more , and takes only still light-produkte , and yet it will get over and that .
why ?
because mike 's only still sitting .
and i watched , how much movement , so , the day and he realizes that in a step back in the bag will put them and the evening i go back draufgeschaut .
and there stood on a thousand steps .
that was so the distance , the right here has in the kitchen to the car with the car into the office there course of a coffee , and the back .
and he came on a thousand steps .
that means that mike was that day , 10 minutes on its legs .
dreiundzwanzig hours and fifty minutes was mike , or whatever was mike .
under those conditions of disease of alone .
and mike 's not why dick , because he too much to eat because long as it up again and energy staut these but not waste of it will inevitably a thicker , and the energy reinsteckt .
and first bauchraum , the energy , how to see here , his staut .
but energy is reaktionsfreudig , the person 's not there .
the mikes 's go back in staut blood .
and also there is it 's active and gefäßen quiet and quiet , his knabbert .
so the blood sugar .
so if the energy blutfetten the blood , then talk about the physicians of high blood sugar and high zurückstaut .
and this blood sugar , the gefäßwand there as with cavities , do it 's all this little further holes in these knabbert .
and a lucky there 's still throughout the fat around and that basically raises , about these little nasty wounds and we speak of fettplagues or 's .
and now comes verklebten heart right under pressure , because now it needs to the blood flowing through these tight mikes pots and pumps and we talk from high blood .
and if this high blood then on this is a fettplague is true , then makes a 's also in the body bang .
and if this at the heart was happening , then we call the heart attack .
and if that in mind has happened then we call that stroke .
and also in germany dies every second , heart attack and stroke .
that is , in germany dies every second , energiestau .
and also mike 's so not so sick because he was no , but because he does n't even more than moving .
and if you these interconnections n't know , then you type in always in the wrong .
for example , the subject of diet .
i have degrees ' yesterday , caloric-restriction diet , amazon in and get there for diätliteratur deutschsprachige suchtreffer , until now .
and if each book only as a centimeter is thick and we would the here diätliteratur , if we have a 30 feet high the current deutschsprachige übereinanderstapeln .
and i was the time for you read all .
and there is inside and now that 's really important if you more energy , so more food as they consume then you will be thick .
and if you less energy , when they consume then you will be thin .
that 's brilliant .
but why we need to contemplate these books ?
that makes just a conclusion to .
for the course , is huge , but diätliteratur is likely to do n't help .
because why have a diet to a hundred percent ?
because it 's a diet is and not a lifestyle .
what you the things that we here three weeks to make and here , draws five weeks ago when we then , after this struggle , again in the normal life back , to our lifestyles .
what then actually , after five or seven weeks ?
nothing .
except on and again , one that in the confidence that we do n't that they 've done , what we rely on .
so you get to small , today at each new diet , in each new trainingsmethode questions and they want that in their day-to-day , in your lifestyle into .
yes or no ?
and if we did , then go .
and if no you make it just stay .
because if the end nothing to come out , it is that time .
it are the habits that 's happened to decide whether we 're sick or stay healthy .
it are the bad habits , we on the sick to do .
and it are the good at the us healthy do .
and if mike in the mirror at then he looks at the result of everyday lifestyle .
if mike in the mirror look , then he look inside , and his daily habits .
and if mike in the mirror at honest and to himself , is , then he looks as well , where it 's the is .
because when he more bad habits as good food and then it 's just saw in the disease his way .
and if mike in the way to the long-term health direction of its goals , direction of its dreams , then it needs to do n't immediately be whole life to .
then he need to just more good behavior as bad .
and a , and habits , mike 's also a great example of that the human being a weird animal is .
mike 's how the example , managed to completely from his life rauszurationalisieren by it away with the car , every man using dynamics , he uses .
and the evening and he 's on the couch and to somehow right back to come .
so it actually , in his pick-up , the gym where there with the an escalator , the sky is yes , already paradox is and will then how this is a rat , again , so a band would happen , so he somehow , movement .
and my grandpa , would have just as well as you .
the was a farmer and the have that did n't understand .
the have said , sports is to people that does n't move .
and somehow he has also pretty much .
why we need to one night in our will spare time that was what we the ground is have ?
now , we have today , in this bewegungsarmen lifestyles after two hours in sports can make a day .
and about much easier to the movement , there to find where we do you 've lost .
the ground .
and so möcht ' i want you today to a perspective from you .
may also know you the situation , you drive the evening , oh , shopping to and in finding that in the front row — no way for free is .
and you see how will , this bewegungsvermeidungsmodus in us is .
we want to always the shortest because of go .
we plan our homes that we had the kürzesten ways .
we plan our entire life is that we the hinwollen ways to have but that leads us but not going there , where we kürzesten .
but in a very different direction .
so you get to today the chancenblick activate and the movement , there , where they 've been on that .
i look like gaza to participate in the track .
and i 'm the only difference , always waking up and down and up and down is going , and everybody else .
but if i mean , hey , because i 'm then nutz ' i mean , the time for me .
then sammel ' i mean , the movement that 's just like this around .
and if from top of the announcement , 30 minutes so , let’s ' i started .
these steps .
that are about three times 10 minutes , translated into .
and a , and talking about three steps , if you today , every day three steps more go then that mean , that they get out for the day , twelve gram of fat not in your body does .
this may be relatively little sound .
but as dreihundertsechzig , as a habit of , chancenblick days in the year then we talk from four point five pounds of fat .
that we do n't in our bodies .
and you give me degrees ' time this , i fettknochen it always nenn .
the americans are nuts , the digits do something so here .
this is a replikat of five pounds of fat .
are that i four pounds .
just so you see , what happened there with these little baby steps .
and if that the effect is coming from this perspective , what you mean , what happens , if you really in a phenomenally active life .
and these gesundheitseffekte the , they 're small , today , every day in their day-to-day .
once you achttausend steps per day , which are , walk you virtually all the rest of them .
and if you then got tired and have time in sports and then they do that mattered on top .
then you have to the fitnesseffekte that , you gesundheitseffekten .
then they will also still evolving faster and stronger .
but do with you your health , is not depend on of sports .
so they make your health , is not depend on the origins of got tired and of their time .
because the most important that most important that they doing now every day as a lifestyle .
and i sportivity a active in nenn .
and for me , it may have become more than a lifestyle , for me it 's a unlike anything that on a clear that decision based for the life and for me itself .
because i think , health has not to do with , what we should do or do to .
but health has to do with , what we want to do .
and so hätt today i just an idea for them .
they have small , today just for the best thing .
and now you can also how can .
step for step .
thank you .
00 how it has a leonardo da actually done on this incredible , what kind of and in the world with other eyes to see ?
and put themselves , so far on the most of what to his time just simply inconceivable , it was ?
we could have that also now ?
that maybe what with companies to do ?
and how we can make of force and here for our future draw ?
we start , let 's on , with the question what do we actually cause of innovation ?
right .
technology and invention of research and development , even the official high-tech-strategie the federal government has the title innovationsstrategie the federal government .
so you know about me .
this is yes , all great .
and we can with quite proud of it be and be grateful that we innovationsführer in these fields are that our technologies around the world to be that it 's good with it goes .
that we do with a so extraordinary , unique wealth .
but what about it with the future from ?
what kind of come because there as a society based on us to ?
and who cares , because there to the big , and social engineering challenges ?
so heut it that somehow , the time .
a kind of labor .
so the economy is taking care , is to the environmental challenges that 's because the entrepreneurs then big effort with the we then productivity and efficiency .
and the the world slightly better do want the find in the lack of organizations and bring together and citizens ' and the need to actually , what companies so basically all these course , then to the damage the new economy to remove themselves .
at least get to fix .
but who says , because that we looked at the as it has been separated at need to ?
how about it because if we do innovationsverständnis to a social and cultural dimension , we need ?
if technological innovation at once again , cultural innovation are ?
if economic innovations together , as social innovation are ?
if it 's go to be able to their thinking and doing to self-assemble with the solution , and social engineering challenges ?
if it very different people have the forces entstünden and if it was a very different , what it 's development in ?
because what was that ?
both sides to help but what companies , right ?
can we do it ?
ask , you may come .
so that we 've always as a way .
thankfully , there 's it provides heartening examples .
by muhammad yunus shared with his zurückzuentwickeln , with his as in bangladesh -- a lot of the consequences to the poverty grammen-bank .
and interestingly , too much more now in direct hilfeorganisationen to the , what the government verlgeich job .
and he has überreicht as entrepreneurs , probably the time , for the nobel zweitausendsechs get .
in the opportunity because it strikes me a i möcht they still with anyone familiar to do .
now , can i introduce you brenner .
now , it 'll be young guy .
's trained , birds . but also its ideals from capsizing .
and yes , where you sympatisch .
i love the flight , like .
and if you see , then you think , real , in the offspring , because we need to us to our future n't going to do .
yes , in the people , and then it somewhere here 's begun to work in one in our mittelständigen is about .
that 's he also very good .
that they took him , and there is also very successful .
and yet it 's still so in him .
so he asks , there is not be more , that somehow in me ?
so this the entrepreneurial -- he says then always .
companies are in all munde .
and that they took him .
and he would have fallen below , these start-up-helden .
so the right there 's also the wirtschaftswoche the , it has detectors which is just get recognized .
so not that he asked him , you know them , but this from the hörensagen tells him the future , what .
and there was in the middle class in the t , three out the knew he did n't .
so we also the more he was surprised when the him , and then the gründergrillen personally was introduced .
when wotsu .
and when actually an entrepreneur who has it actually , then there ever imagined .
the great pleasure think , so with young people together , there his his experience that .
and the two have fallen in each other found .
and have now , i met .
how about it because if we , we just so in a lot of these conversations from the two times reinhorchen ?
yes wotsu , so how was that because right .
what 's exactly the difference between 'nem between start-up 'nem and 'nem a company ?
that i still not so , to be understood .
yes , so , you then let 's actually , we , here in the question what 's actually etabliertes companies ?
so name says , yes .
they were creating markets , they were creating products , established business customers , established structures , there 's a history .
and you can also quite exactly the give , where the great things go .
and make a schramme , even though the very neat is it can also go down .
what 's because then actually a start-up ?
so , you , you can already so one thing is it does n't guarantee it 's just not the small copy of a big company .
it 's something very different .
it has a completely different character .
because it has , nothing etabliertes .
no more customers , no geschäftsmodel etabliertes , nothing is known .
so it 's a start-up a temporary organization that the purpose is a business plan to be here , to find , to develop the impact of this is , of course that , but importantly , finally is and then they scale .
and you 're certainly understand that 's natural in this führungsverständnis organization very different very different ways of thinking there , very different 'ner , very different ways .
yes , that 's me already solved it .
but what we look for because actually ?
so , i got 'em , and then it is , because you , and sauhaufen 'nen to make money or ?
so i also degrees , that fits very well , so now is found in berlin would you me that recommendation system ?
that is to exit-strategie .
how you sidestepped your business to succeed ausgesorgt and after the millionen-exit your life for verkaufst have .
oh no .
but really ausgesorgt ?
what you think because if you start with the beginning , 30 lebensperspektive have the money what 's because after your sauhaufen ?
so when you just a career as passive konsumfetischist or what ?
what if you with your commitment , as i know you ?
and also , we look , let 's the lottospieler .
so the statistics about lottogewinner give you 're not quite confident perspective , because seventy percent of lottogewinner are few years after that in a lot 's financial situation when your big .
money is always the result of a successful company and of a good at it enterprise .
now , you money is an energy source for an enterprise actions .
and it the basis of all over economy .
but it 's never the goal of a company .
yes , what is then the goal ?
the company ?
so , i guess what are . i 've learned , so without the goal is no way the right .
and so , goals to help but then and measurable in time and so forth .
and when i do all that 's not him , and so that 's how can i for something of the way i do n't know what i look for ?
so that i do n't feel good .
so how do i , since the choice and and risks to go through this feels like us , for me it all of and inherently uncertain .
yes , you welcome the enterprise .
but i realize there may what for you .
one thread .
so the is yes , sagenumworben , so , secret .
and familienunternehmen of generation to -- .
a spickzettel for business instincts .
so , or how does tell you today ?
gell that i , start-up-spirit ?
so we say , always spirit-spicker .
for all the crises and more and more sustainable way .
so for it is guaranteed .
i believe that one person , i can see you one of them to their own .
okay .
yes , thanks , mister wotsu .
but there are just ask it .
that can see you 'll notice a the big these qualities is good leaders questions to imagine .
we can the time one after the other to go through , that i do may understand better ?
so the first is what am i here and what i want to here to happen ?
yes , you , there 's hear dadrum what moves that 's about you know , the greater is when you yourself ?
what bewirkst you on the world ?
what have the people of them , if you with you work ?
what you ready to give them ?
what are your inner , may also become unconscious antriebskräfte ?
why is this so important that to see it ?
because that are also your business enterprise antriebskräfte .
and how that we 've learned ?
if you a ship to then trommele not the men together bits of work a hot , it wood to collect but i teach them , for the people , which is , an ocean .
yes , good .
so then i look over time , let me the next questions .
what 's my zielzustand gewünschter ?
what is that ?
yes , you now you can do your goal really well , let me .
i could color in detail , and colorful , but i vorstellst in a moment ago , if you went warn , what you would n't want and then it , you 're going .
you know , the story with the pink and elephants ?
it strikes me there is a .
not ?
others .
so , pass on .
reset your time , not a pink and elephants ago .
okay ?
it works ?
so no turning pink and elephants .
me ?
no turning pink and elephants .
you see ?
so let 's us , if we so on them focus on that , what we do n't want .
what is there 's actually the only way ?
because it hinauszukommen ?
yes , now , you get through the ago , what you want .
so beiwagenmotorrad kannikel or maybe the take on the quietschgelbe .
but it 's a ago .
the way , what i just to you like krimis or ?
i brought .
look over time , whether you can the rausbekommst .
murdured somebody in this room sounds clearly lord smith .
who that ?
at blunt of blunted this brutally what afternoon thirty-four to death with a precicely more serious .
i took deed of you to precicely me your whereabouts at tell the time that that each want place .
i bedroom the glass in the master polishing .
what below-stairs scones lordships his buttering , sir .
and i what shed my potting in the petunias plunking .
constable custody lady smith .
oh , he did you know ?
madam as any until petunias does you one tell adversity do would culturist and it is similar .
take all .
it 's just a matter of observation .
the real where is about observant question you ?
and you look like from ?
is what noticed ?
has anything changes ?
okay .
okay , and the flower , too .
okay .
so , then we can look , let 's then we looking where the bear with that is .
and action .
murdured somebody in this room sounds clearly lord smith .
who that ?
at blunt of blunted this brutally what afternoon thirty-four to death with a precicely more serious .
i took precicely of you to whereabouts me your tell at each the time that that want place .
i bedroom the glass in the master polishing .
what below-stairs scones lordships his buttering , sir .
and i what shed my potting in the petunias plunking .
constable custody lady smith .
and you , like it 's hear that ?
so , i know , i was also be shocked .
i was really shocked .
when i the first time ever seen nothin ' .
i thought it can probably not be .
and still much more shocking , i was as i plunged through the head , is it could be that i actually the sort of this way through the area over ?
through my life .
and okay , i understand that makes yes , meaning .
to wake up there the immediate melt down to prevent that we spend most of our perception and our wahrnehmungsfilter find out to .
but what 's because now , i mean ?
so striking writers ' i was and what blend ' i from ?
and why do , realize you your perception and how they somewhere hinzurichten to have , is a more entrepreneurial quality .
well , yes , thanks , then we get , let 's to the next question .
how could i actually to my goal ?
so , that i find a good question .
that that when i think that because every time , and i know that somehow not going to go ahead .
yes , you , there 's a good news for you .
that you get lighter than you that may have ever known as you .
because if you your care of what 's clear , your inner drive and if you went 'n in the very of introduced you said , i promise you , is it inside of happen by .
almost automatically .
you 'll do n't really differently than that a brainstorming in you is that things on it .
that are then these famous einfälle , the morning together under the shower have .
and still a question i 'm going to college , look good , who you can go who you to asking for advice , could transform the more input , more at home to get .
and you 've also a model .
the who have this is really marry .
when by duke cosimo , if the , is not know , has the in his located invited in florence .
for lunch , the big table .
and it 's totally different people .
so scientists , streitkultur , politician , the bankers , as engineers , architects and he has a very intense militärstrategen clean .
but not in our world today , , where you went , yes , who , literacy ?
who has been right ?
but rather pleased to that of these different blickachsen things are the so on none of metaphysical way , one of them alone could have come up anywhere .
well , yes , the next question is called the concrete next step i do this ?
you do , successful entrepreneur in the reason very simple .
instead of debt to anticipate and management and so on them , makes just on the next step .
because what to because in terms of uncertainty also do ?
but the lead this very determined and with all the consequence out .
and if there 's and then nothing was well , dan be here , you know , 'nen different step .
and even if the big , colorful zielvorstellung ausgemalte nothing was then there 's , wait a different .
it 's why it 's so important that you through your what 's clear .
so that kills the security .
and the way as we 've actually all we go to learn ?
although we that would n't know , and it nobody has said ?
-- she says you also have children .
so , this playful attempt to explore this and cultivate this start-up playful attempt for it 's also , this is fun that in a company is happening in a freudvolle .
and that 's also what a lot of the framework is against the uncertainty , the us who would always been so anxious .
yes , thank wotsu .
so this sounds awesome .
but i do n't know so , in my place in the company , i think there must , here 's a lot of a change that there anything happens .
and ourselves over me here in germany wants there 's always been so these things go .
and i believe that one person , there would have to the politicians , that make that changes .
okay my boy , come with .
how to go down the water .
what you think , how many people can you change ?
ten ?
10 thousand ?
ten million ?
look at here comes down .
and you see ?
alright , the .
this is the most unjust cause you change the , you really change .
or to make it with mahatma gandhi to say , looking for the change that you in the world is in you yourself .
do you feel safe beautiful words and big models , but how would that because it work ?
because we have thankfully , still 'n few spirit-spicker on our notfalltropfen .
helpful in all vorart of crises , or if you to small share with for something or if you a collapsing up and they have all with you to do .
and if you fall in these situations probably wondering what we now despite all that you , which is what you take too can physically unfit to it to feel .
that time , what you know , give them liked it , above the you just ärgerst .
and finally , that you , what you actually sort of this crisis , or the , what happened is because you .
so i mean , if you already happening is that , at least was worth it has .
yeah well .
wotsu thank you .
and you think really wanting to me that helps it on my have gone ?
yes .
and realize for neurotransmission , two things .
first time is on the clarity of your inner wozus that , then to your because what will .
because that controls your perception .
and for the second one on your inner attitude towards itself .
because so bestimmst you like the other people to you behave .
future is always just then if we our own perception of changing .
traust you downloaded this to ?
yes , i think twice .
thank wotsu well then .
all good you brenner .
yes .
what you think of our do ?
nice .
really , or , gell ?
and how we because now , with this start-up-spirit ?
this is a new innovationskultur ?
i mean , yes .
clear .
which i , is the spirit of myself .
inspirare is to breathe up .
and this is that , what the entrepreneur really is .
a schlückchen from some potions for the euphoria .
and no , so new innovationskultur , too .
that 's quite the gründergeist .
is what the country , long time in the big names fortlebt .
from robert , about daimler graf werner zeppelin or gustav or how they all .
let 's just that spirit 're ready .
and who knows maybe it out of our do the next one of our time .
you see , i 'm hochschwanger .
maybe it would be so that i deal with kids and their future of thing because finally we 're children the future .
instead is that the view , i of the time enjoy .
i spend one of my life in prison .
four years ago have my father and i the program leonhard , entrepreneurship for prisoners , started sybase .
we could qualify strafgefangene entrepreneurial , that is , you can control for the life either on making or find after their was lighter one in the they then also can hold .
why the time i was so now , so happened to strafgefangene , so the ones who already have are the big mistake i 've done ?
our program is a much not so easy to understand how programs that , is to kids who care .
and frankly , i would have thought that the knast the last place in the universe is , in the i work would .
what you think that 's the most a factor in the time i was with the people with that we work ?
we figure out , it are positive role models of male , models .
and if you think about , why it in certain schulprobleme so many erziehungsprobleme and so many umfeldern there are often is it that the father was no sensible work has that he had that he drugs consumed or that he was have in prison is .
and if then a seven-year-old child think about what he from his life like to make it has cells might do n't actually better idea , like a different lives might look because he was no better models .
and he eifert his father .
i möcht you imagine .
martin 's a our program .
his dad was an alcoholic and made the entire family life this the hell .
when he was 12 was is his mother died , and he and be a little baby brother actually had the home .
there was he the prellbock the great .
he was shy and schmächtig and so the perfect .
to the day when be a little baby brother , in a soccer game so roughly gefoult been is that this the ground has remained .
there were in the first time the end by , he went on the enemy and proposed to .
and that day , he was respect .
and it went off .
violence was part of well , to his life just like in his father .
how it goes well , ones that i just described , on ?
after the childhood , the youth who are lots of unemployed or have gelegenheitsjobs .
you 're not much different than your illegal activities and their problembehafteten spaces .
and then they are no one day with people in jail is closed organizations that 's exactly how she is , their thoughts about the same community over the also not a better models are .
about what , you think that think these people together , if you get together in prison in prison ?
mostly about not much good .
and they will criminals in knast .
they sell and drugs on a higher level and plan still in the prison where they 're going to see the prison einbrechen could .
and this thing is then in germany to sechsundvierzig of rückfallquoten percent .
that is , in germany will everyone on her second thing you go back .
then there 's but also people in prison , the really change want .
but also these people wear a rubber stamps in the forehead .
and there 's knacki .
and everywhere , where they come , is that your first identity .
if you make a place to work for , whether you make an apartment for whether they new private build a relationship to anywhere you 'll end with this identity , with this to face , the you one of others reenter society that 's like this infinitely hard power .
this is the problem , in the we are .
how we try and that problem to solve ?
what kind of vulnerability , you think that bring a lot of strafgefangene with ?
they will be surprised .
it are so capabilities .
who owns a mitarbeiterführung 's built up has definitely no idea of vertriebswegen , of marketingstrategien and of drogenring .
the subject of climate has a little gehapert , otherwise something he 's not in prison that space .
these characteristics we want to something good use .
we start our program with a zwanzigwöchigen education in prison , in three on .
we get all of the kind of entrepreneurship and economics .
everyone to write its own business and everybody who takes a comprehensive persönlichkeitstraining part .
and then with we the people also to see the custody at the unternehmensgründung , and i wohnungssuche in the equations with your personal relations and also in a cocktail of arbeitsplatzsuche .
oh , what then go from our program ?
it 's a big range , from the suchmaschinenoptimierung to the agency for edv-trainer .
we have a pflegedienst tätowierer .
a very large bandwidth and to do möcht ' i just like to imagine .
philipps their talent and his illusion is money to have been very early surveys , trade with the cocaine seduced .
he had always been fun doing it , businesses to run .
he 's then zweitausendacht the first time , had been .
and those who has n't very impressed me .
the contrary .
he says sound -- today , he 've arrived at its second life prepared .
zweitausendelf is he then the second time been wrongfully convicted .
he took then only a therapy part and then the leonhard-programm .
and there , he did as he would be their talent for something legales can use .
he 's in september of its been , then october suchmaschinenoptimierung his agency for zweitausenddreizehn started sybase .
the agency is going , well , it can now of life .
he has very good stuff joking .
he is today with me here .
who likes to know them to talk to bring it .
well , back to martin , and from the i told him the start telling my life .
martin has been , his childhood education to leave and ended up in his play in the hooligan-szene münchener .
and because alcohol , and drugs , had the agenda are was be cycle , i quickly started .
he worked in parallel when a dj decks and as a security guard .
twenty years , he took this life .
and he says , today , that he was out with this fabulous lifestyle to be not about self-confidence kompensiert .
one day that he who wants to about a schlägerei so hard that he then convicted .
he took the persönlichkeitstraining part and that leonhard-programm there has really be life changed .
he learned , he , to more force to more success and to more life index coming to live without its just to make juice or without drugs to consume .
and he was one of knowledge , so excited that he had decided to he likes to pass .
and he wanted to sequence of the leonhard-teams be .
that has that .
he works for now , two years at us and coacht our participants on your way in the freedom , because he knows that , if you really change to , and if you have the right tools with the hand get that much more possible is when you 're oftentimes i want to .
the basis of these successes are by humans as you .
people , the with us to prison , the external sessions with us come to wed our participants in their businessplänen , in your personal plans to get you .
that are our position , the textkorrekturen talks in our class , this is that students at the marktrecherchen do , ehrenamtliche the business plans to .
and that are our mentors , the our participants in the best thing to the prison with .
and also these people take a lot of our program with .
one example .
we do on our events , an exercise , the step-to-the-line calls .
we then in the center of space a big on our participants , on the and our people standing on the other side .
and i then of questions .
and , each time someone in space that question with you answer is he 's going to the line ago .
and here shows , wondering what we all have , whether we within the prison sit or outside .
but also , where the differences .
and a example of that , where the differences , is the following question .
i 'm in a call social right up , or i was a family member of what us , in custody .
there are usually very many of our participants in front of the line and just very few of our environment .
a question that i 'd like , the us all together , the möcht ' i 'd like you imagine .
i urge you that they all get up .
maybe we can be a little light in the audience .
i can you see .
it all .
terrific .
thank you .
i get to tell you a question and if you that question answering them , again , otherwise you just stand .
this is , our our line that we now .
i have in my life of things done , for the i would have may be able to it was but not .
if you that question answering them , please .
to count , car .
to count , maybe as low levels of the marijuana , obsessed .
to count , it with the seat , we do in fact , have them .
okay .
and it 's also to think that may have any workforce that 's not always very accurate we have them .
all right .
most of your seats .
we have a few angel in space .
that 's wonderful , because i 'm happy .
thank you , they 're allowed notes , all back down .
in this question , if that we went on the events , imagine , get our environment very often the mulling stage .
and you will also realized how much , very lucky you may have had .
happiness with the parents , happiness with the environment , when they grew up , with the friends , but also very lucky that they may not always get caught by these are if you something on the legalität , or , beyond that did .
what are the results of our work ?
in percent of our alumni from within fünfundzwanzig days after their was a workplace .
that 's very quickly .
one percent , have already is done .
a third of the donors are in the last year we were leonhard-absolventen .
and our rückfallquote is at seven percent .
i had it already told the sechsundvierzig of seven percent of rückfallquote in germany of rückfallquote percent .
i 'm betriebswirtin .
a bayern costs in strafgefangener per year , taxpayers thousand dollars .
and it 's a beautiful sechsundvierzig , -- what a rückfallquote of seven percent of rückfallquote of usually zahlenspiel percent for one that means .
when my father and i together that leonhard-programm founded have , we 're quite frankly first group of pretty much for quite nuts were literally .
i whistled at my great marketingjob in a big businesses , given up .
but i want to tell you . i got in my life still not as a bereichernde work done .
we encourage our participants , responsibility to take over .
responsibility , what in your life 's happened , and most responsible for it to wrestle , what in their lives will happen .
not to hide , nothing to will .
because that leads to a new consumer confidence and what it 's also , again , trust to build up .
and therefore it makes me , especially happy and proud if our participants , of their way to report .
now i showed you a little video with them .
film .
so i was convicted to two years and eight months because i körperverletzung .
i was because of betäubungsmittelgesetz against the verstoß to three years and 10 months convicted .
i have with the marijuana , it .
so , i no judgment of two years get sued because i körperverletzung .
i was convicted of btm and handeltreiben unerlaubtem with körperverletzung .
so , through my participation in leonhard , there has actually my whole life changed .
and what to me as important was , these persönlichkeitsentwicklung , the also is made .
because there was my yes , my absolute it .
i was n't gesellschaftsfähig , '' i say , yes .
i picked up again , eyes tip .
i picked up again perspective of survival . i 've got back to jump forward at it .
and you go with a very different awareness and consciousness from the prison out .
so far was going to , abgerutscht without a fixed set goals and then is you know , in and anything planlos .
with the wrong people together and this now , is not .
well , the problem is that lots of no health , if the out .
that the biggest problem , because then is a way that you go back in the old track .
you know nothing else .
by this persönlichkeitstraining individual coaching , whatever , what 's where everything offered is , there has been to me just my whole mindset of me ask yourself , about other , above the things that you with issues , above the things that you with the society , that has been to me just during these two weeks , totally focused around .
i 've been neunzehnhundertfünfundneunzig of my first woman in divorce .
and since have six months ; i go back with her together .
so that means , we have a new relationship started .
and because when i think , among other through this whole werteunterrichte and many other things have changed .
so much . ' i 've achieved .
i 'm with my family back into the great point the education started .
so i work today in my career , '' i say .
i 'll just a it-systemkaufmann to vollzeitweiterbildung .
you have to that actually acknowledge that it 's very , many people there are the fact , like for example of my mentor now , talk about this time still out and actually be true , i do n't know , zugesagtes engagement beyond the people are going on .
i 'm grateful for that you , on the idea at all come are that they so what do .
i 'm grateful for that you , it , with safety of difficulty was have and i 'm extremely grateful that i would be part of me .
to belong , they also all the people , the support groups that were .
i acted as i said with many people in the events , talked , and the me again and confirmed that 's good , that , ' .
and the wind ' i also do .
and for the thing i thank you .
they come up with us in jail .
each of you has something that we need to .
if you our participants in their referent , which will , whether you as the businessplänen to come from us whether you the u.n . a financial support these are .
if you our program in a new akutes want to wear , very bundesland issue .
so that would you please .
martin , and i are here today .
and excited to us on the conversation with them .
thank you .
entwicklungseinsatz i got involved in 'nen hilfsorganisation for 'ner represent zweitausendneun in nepal applied .
in a time in the i do something that there was .
, you do things like .
for auslandseinsätze that .
the jakobsweg go .
a sabbatical in the monastery .
there 's today really of possibilities like you with real deal .
or how to it is your cubicle .
anyway , i was zweitausendneun also a way .
with my work and so 'n bit with the gesamtsituation .
which i here 's really kind of luxusunzufriedenheit talk to .
and not from real problems .
my problem was i was siebenundzwanzig and was able to me exactly what would like my life in 10 or two , 30 years , will look .
it was a .
and those who i found rather frightening .
it to recommend this .
basically , i had an adult quarterlife crisis observatory .
now as private .
i knew just do n't want me to the geebneten way to go ?
do it me just lazy way ?
or what if i mean lebenswürfel it ?
and look , then what happens .
what then on me wait .
that were so the thoughts .
i was in this time to embrace reisejournalistin to about a day .
as i said luxusunzufriedenheit .
the reisejournalismus for me was also in spite of the total certainty that .
you 've traveled free the world who lives in very good hotels and traveled the country on a very privilegierte way and way .
've traveled but to also very unprivilegierte countries .
developing countries where it certainly more to see , and say there than about things with villages kind lächelnden people for the , though they have nothing , so about happiness and joy from .
what a lot of these images and cliché about living but really chronicles a kind of the cars .
and that is what was for me to a while the key .
i was that what i did to little bit .
so there .
and i found it 's a little anmaßend of me about a country to write to judge that i actually do n't really know .
that i wanted to change .
i wanted to countries are really know them .
authentischere was invited to write .
and to my personal passion to be breastfeeding .
how you 're learning that are the better know ?
by showing you with the people who lives .
once in the people who lives , in them home .
not in the hotel .
by communication , with the challenges and with the problems with the people too busy .
and so as you with the people who works .
at that was the answer that i want me on this question there could .
and that i wanted to do .
and i wanted something worthy research doing .
i wanted to contribute at .
something to do good .
and this sense , there has been to me , are working at a nepalreise still further .
i was it never before , for quite often in developing but for me just particularly touched .
until zweitausendsechs was there 's a the civil society , not just a ton of orphans , but also plenty economic and social problems , .
with an annual income of fünfhundertfünfzig euros of nepal is the poorest country in asia .
and sewage and continue to one of the two decades , the poorest countries around the world .
a quarter of the population lives below the poverty .
almost a fifth of the population suffer from malnutrition .
forty percent of the adult male ca n't read and write .
all these facts are connected with you very personal stories and experiences that i do on this journey were like me in a time in the i was willing and frankly was to change .
in the i even something to .
and drum up after i got back out of nepal my decision .
i quit my job .
and she taught me , the aid .
and i möcht now , too short excerpt of the answer them the out , i mean that received .
because they just one of was .
it 's going to a serious and in 'nem international by a global companies .
and not to a weltenbummlerin for a flippige auffangstelle the , degrees in nepal want to live and a funding of her and in place .
hi ?
let 's still ?
my bid was really seriously , and good .
at least i thought that .
and this answer was a frechheit bodenlose .
i was really just plowing down .
and of course , an emotional response to finish writing .
and luckily , never works .
instead , i do this intense sense to what good it to make .
i have it 's used as an engine , to my own business to reasons .
karmalaya .
heart work and soul travel .
a company that in basically exactly that offers , what i then for innovation .
which is the possibility , a country unlike to do .
the possibility , a country right to meet .
by i do with the people there , life and can work .
and it 's not anywhere can work , but in to entwicklungsprojekten .
karmalaya you can actually in the two words that 's break .
so karma , and laya .
that means much , how place , unless you good and can gather .
, unless you 're doing good .
so this is now 'n little bit now .
but it is not .
travel is a social karmalaya business .
we use the tourism , as a tool for sustainable development .
specifically what we use voluntourismus as a tool for sustainable development .
so volunteering , volunteering and unsustainable tourism .
because the people , the with us to afford , during and it has helped them .
they pay for their journey up , like a different and so .
but they travel just different .
you live in gastfamilien .
and the main goal is n't care as much recovery or a lot interkultureller but real sightseeing exchange .
social engagement .
and out .
to engage myself , our participants , the first qualification , and interests in various projects .
we can go through our work one thing , such unsustainable tourism in the periphery of the otherwise , no chance on the tourism have happened .
because just the necessary infrastructure to call the missing .
to another we can send sustainable design projects .
we can own sustainable design projects -- and finance .
we 're so to a hundred percent of myself .
are also on not donations wheelchair-bound .
and that 's just showing us to our long term , `` engagement of meaning .
now we have , our work zweitausendzehn in nepal .
a year we have our engagement in uganda , expanded .
and now after about four years turned out , we now i 've got married and my husband and i are also for a team was a altbekannte question .
we go into the geebneten gone further ?
or what if we still getting bigger than thinking ?
if we the entwicklungsgedanken still going on this ?
if we do with not just social engagement and so travel around my point of development in his wholeness that ?
and so that , the individual persönlichkeitsentwicklung what ?
or specialty , führungskräfteentwicklung .
that would then , after a new one extra companies .
a company that , or their company itself .
with other karmalaya but the same philosophy of how schwerpunkten .
we want that ?
was the next question .
now new business ?
sure that we want that .
we love entrepreneur and their creative companies .
because we buy a ticking .
because we the same language to talk .
because we are the same have sweet dreams .
because we the challenges of understanding .
and why we 've done in this year karmalaya one sister to dive .
kaliis .
and with entwicklungsprojekte we 're creative companies in of development and what kaliis that we really extraordinary people are going on .
to accompany we the participants , entrepreneur , or a lot of creative companies with individual to coachings .
so teilnehmers the personal social and interkulturelle too have the coachings include .
and entwicklungseinsatz the on the coachings for .
the there 's in kaliis also again .
a terrific use the next to a meaningful wissensaustausch still a huge advantage .
he shows a in relatively short time on where you or where you ansteht .
where you may still -- the unconscious biases .
where you might want to me a very flexible , is to say in thinking .
and he shows a on , what you really well , is .
one of his the eyes .
it may be the creativity , the sudden , great is .
or whether it 's the for the you new in fact , discovered .
the make things just assume that you could n't we can change .
and the force , things to change that you can change .
and you can be very much change .
already in very short time .
we know that .
a example .
this is that replacing rose selivia , and margeret .
that are five women from uganda .
with about fortunes and with their talent .
they make beautiful , where halsketten for years .
and for years on is nothing .
because they simply no market for it had .
because they did n't know , as you the quality can improve .
because you that nobody has said , which design may have in the question .
we wanted to these women help .
and have so this year , also a produktlabel started sybase .
empowerment kaliare product .
products in the people of poverty , .
the you a year , there .
a future to occur .
we 're talking yesterday with our online-shop live gone .
and we start with an that empowerment edition .
a halsketten edition of a thousand limitierte of our women .
the sale get you 're not only for a year after a income .
but allows us as well , the project is still a lot larger to make .
this first when 's sort of social crowd funding and produktstart in a .
so who are going to , can this one thing , with the purchase a chain of doing to another it could , but with us directly into the project travel .
it can get to the women were traveling and actively mitengagieren .
the long , we want not only five women get a give but fifty or a hundred .
and that 's not just in uganda , but also in nepal and in other projektländern , where we 're working .
and what is but this produktbereich just a project from our , cycle of projects .
we 're working in all the central areas .
in infrastructure education and health and entrepreneurship and it .
because the work in just one area just to little bit is .
what happens with the children when the women who work ?
right .
so we have this year , in nepal and in uganda , two childcare to set up .
everything and in our so uneasily together .
and looked at the power still more sense , as any one project for yourself .
participants in place where we ever been , qualification , in the different projects .
the width of opportunities to wait , and then always just in the common work .
and for the closing i want to now , right on a journey to take them .
and to do , i urge you the eyes to close .
reset your sell you 're in africa .
in rural heart of uganda .
you 're sitting in one of wooden dining room .
and are satisfied and it anymore .
you 've just with your family to had lunch .
there 's kochbananenpüree .
matoke .
tasty .
the walls are this .
in there is it 's warm .
you blickst of the window .
and see these kids in the lehmstraße rotbraunen 'm sure .
their flinken feet what the sand on .
you unterarme on your blickst .
also on them is a thin layer oranger dust .
the children with laughter .
and yell out to enjoy your names .
you 're looking forward to piss you , is not only mzungu call .
weißhaut .
you know what do n't , what time it 's .
but soon you going to get up .
and the entlanggehen , on the men 's still the children were , lehmstraße .
the end of the street is a tree .
here you going with lydia .
in the 're sitting in the shadow are you probably the new designs of their halsketten talk about .
so , as you like a with your hands and feet to talk .
later , but also the other women .
they smile erwartungsvoll .
until you with your english to start loving .
under the tree .
in a free-fall .
and that it here yet the internet , there .
this morning skypest you again with your coach .
when you lie .
the exchange is every time value .
and it 's beautiful time again deutsch , to talk .
you hear music .
and that klirren of them .
mom or is in the courtyard of the pots .
it 's a small song .
you 're more relaxed , and happy .
you 're doing the eyes , again , do .
each of us can the grundentscheidung to meet , do something new in .
now , or for a short time the dice me to throw .
and to look what happens .
thank you .
before i start , would interest me , whether of you tonight is that they 're here , hey , somebody 'n ' house , has .
i just with the light it does n't really well , but perhaps want to someone you .
down here just know , i somebody .
two .
here , the sky here i 'm not , but anyway , down here are hey , two , that 's beautiful , we 're already time to dritt .
i see , you a building , and that is the kind of the city stuttgart .
this is the building .
together with six to other people i the villa out in the last summer , six months , .
and so stuck , i tonight is here from them .
well , and , like now some of you might say .
so what 's also ?
hausbesetzer there 's many .
but i want to it 's a little bit .
oh , her , now the villa along ?
and her zeltet then in park or how ?
just a small plant choice of the questions that we know , friends , colleagues have asked when you know you have that i became part of an initiative with the i started to , something occupy-villa-berg names , provokantem am .
all expected , that we will seamlessly in the series of the eingereiht occupy-bewegung had .
and here around the this is parolen up , zelte world faces and so on which had .
and to fight against the privatization of this is to stop protesting .
but who knows , knows that 's not my kind of myself .
and it was also not the elected protestform the initiative .
what we see here , is a sign of the stuttgart passage in calwer .
this is a public space , the one you privately is , and therefore , for many people do n't available to it says , möcht ' i do n't say , but it 's not in the hand is and will not so be used can you how to public spaces may make use .
we were a group of sinnstiftend together in the desire with bausubstanz identitätbildender and an stuttgartern , sensitive and sustainable deal .
and we wanted a different occupy-geschichte tell .
we were a interdisciplinary team and that i have to now very quickly see , because it was a very buntes team .
this from the other aspects of architecture , planning social -- , politics -- and projektmanagement bürgerbeteiligung , statistics , design , music , photography stadtforschung , kulturwissenschaften and they 're about .
of course , along with different social cultural and intimate one .
our perspective ergänzten and the day .
and have us to , on different skills , came in various networks where .
and creative in we solutions in the teamintern the , then we did have , beteiligungsprozess to realize .
we 've actually navigated directly , the villa out to occupy .
but went to us about that we try villa with stories and ideas will occupy .
we have memories and images being asked .
and from these memories and images out , up to think of perspective for the space to develop .
and then it was it 's important that the process always be constructive .
us as an initiative for myself , we 've always than outside thinking platform and as sprachrohr terms .
so was bürgerbeteiligungsexperiment a mental and in and was after , and according to a occupy-villa-berg .
on the experiences that we 've done , möcht ' i tonight is to go .
every city has identitätstiftende places .
the a neighborhood a face there .
in many cases this , privatized law and commercialized and be in the result of citizens of strangers are places .
they are the dead places a city , because it 's commonly do n't escape that correspond to what we 're in a public space expect .
so for example , that we aufenthaltsqualität have , sitzmöglichkeiten have .
this , but also the fact , public , the urban places , neglected , this will often did .
square , the places like that would want , often , if you 're interested in the only about this .
what 's also with me to do , like it 's some questions , like some outside of questions .
i mean , a lot .
these places , giving our town 's not just a face .
no .
they are the social places of our town , in the our social life is happening .
so actually how we often first zarte ties to our neighbors , if we were random on the way shopping to meet .
and can take this increase , if we just a a possibility , to have to sit , and we actually stop , if the spaces are also , that are .
and just as we actually they converge .
so , then form friendships , sometimes .
but what 's certainly , it 's a sense of community .
the more in i in this is a public space , the faster and become more energy is just might also that community .
and when i 'm not wohlfühle , then it 's room that , what you probably the on a big city called .
we were then two challenges .
we can accumulate in the citizens of consciousness , responsibility and engagement for your neighborhood , i 've or in wiedergeweckt also zweifelsfall be .
how can get in the creation be transformed ?
how it 's fair criticism in ideas will be transformed ?
protest against the privatization , and if this verwahrlosung bedeutsamen places and criticism against the twin towers and actually also not much stadtgeschichtlich just looked at the same places .
imagine if you say , that they sit here , once ago , they beat the newspaper on and read this text .
love to empower intellectuals and citizens , we invite you a we want them three possible varieties for the redesigning the planungsbüro imagine the a carefully now marktplatzes designed .
they 're allowed in the connectivity to the idea of a nuance choose .
and the variation in america , the most bürgerstimmen is then being implemented .
they would go ?
would anyone of them to this event go ?
probably not .
why not ?
i mean , it sounds insulin-resistant , great .
there 's a possibility , what it .
they have to mitgestalten how that in the future looks .
and as i said , like you 're insulin-resistant , and in the first moment .
i try to me anyway , an explanation .
and it changes , because i the thing i 'm they ca n't really work or pick up or participating , mitgestalten .
so one , because that classical ansetzt often too late to bürgerbeteiligung .
that means mostly they have no opportunity , really your suggestions to make or some alternatives to discuss them , but there 's actually been a design and they have to geranien still going to decide whether they stiefmütterchen or allenfalls in the city 's the green plants .
or , as a friend other day said , what color the trash can have , for example .
second one explanation that classical bürgerbeteiligung 's rarely spoke about information and vote out .
you think , the three vorgestellten varieties .
we have is what that we want to show you and they must then you can vote .
frustration and you 're often the follow what i also some way they think .
i certainly have to no choice about blumenbeet or 'nem meeting when i actually rather a bmx , instead stiefmütterchen geranien have had .
it goes but also different .
although we on the overcoming the existing beteiligungsfrustration lot of conversations that cost has we have finally too much for experience .
so , then we have experience came away and the , i 'll for others beteiligungsprozesse share .
i want to pass , another square , other projects , but one or , are going to the city manager , and at the public policy .
because i just the ones who are , the camera that beteiligungsprozesse actually able to play , and the really responsible for these are .
if which is really the interest in what is , how it so often toward and it will then we need and then we need the who did this new beteiligungsformate .
not , richt ' i but also , they all that you today , sit here .
and it 's why , because i bürgerbeteiligung for very is important .
i , it for important that they all go , and i want to it with our example encourage , the bürgerbeteiligung still a chance to give them .
and i 's me , they all , because they are very , the period , who did a new beteiligungskultur it can .
so we have to what happens if you look like to compete with the citizens of consciousness , responsibility and engagement for your neighborhood and these participation and mitgestaltung to stir up ?
one willingness to calculate the dialogue box on a level .
in projektverantwortliche professionals in layman , citizens on beteiligungsprozessen and different interests of time together .
what we see here , is a picnic table , to the we invited to have .
what we see here , are some bezirksräte and local authorities in conversation with citizens .
the goal to be , that all these conversations on a place , so that not the fachlichen interests , or the fachlichen skills about the missing in the citizens .
the citizens there , are experts , they 're experts for your neighborhood , you know what you 've been missing , which kindheitserinnerungen you with a place to connect , in which to be a place and also , what you there , lacking .
the gesamtstädtischer , especially in the city can bring , what on projektverantwortlichen level in the project into the individuals .
in alone or in in a particular case can then another fachexperten be involved the themes of complimenting , the just goes on the project which are , the places .
all this leads to a ideenfindungsprozess , for all of information for all to are and the then the place to this can .
by may also to get to evolve , the an identification of the place to hack .
a dialogue box on a also means that the capacity for the residents in fact taken seriously .
and it 's also then , if someone says , i want a stadtteilbauernhof near the marketplace .
that can course , in one is be , but the goal to be , in stadtteilbauernhof dialogue with all just zweifelsfall , what is the right solution and maybe in herauszukristallisieren then also the 'nem people , but maybe a different place .
well , to take this out of the conversation turns out of nowhere .
second point are ways beteiligungsformate .
our stadtgesellschaft 's colorful .
one feels like us , totally , when he ago 'ner big amorphous group and can talk .
a different stream can see is good writing to but the text , then not ago 'ner big amorphous group to talk .
a different to what might get hostile or photographing it .
or his ideas in mindmap 'ner on .
what i want to say it has to different beteiligungsformate give to transform flavors of all right by becoming monotonous .
we have here for example , the possibility , simple to come , there to be , they 're insulin-resistant , anyway , what happens .
in the background a small exhibition .
we have is the possibility of out , videointerviews to give them .
we have the possibility of out , to paint .
we have the possibility of out , to write .
regardless of the age .
that was a fünfjähriges girl .
we had the possibility , our ideas with their faces to connect to kick the ideas to verorten .
also the possibility , outside of zeitunabhängig zusammenkünften to participate , should always been able to be .
that can example , about a projektraum happen , that can do about 'nen internetportal happen .
the idea and transparent availability of the results of the dialogue , under the are .
we even have the whole process in parallel postulate on facebook with him and on one of independent blog and at the news timely talk about a newsletter that groups .
our third point ergebnisoffenheit .
remember the maybe that i said that beteiligungsprozesse often too late to take place .
in my erfundenen event there 's already three finished the planning .
'nem is the process but only then when he early , takes place and the those who do best , even still do n't know , what ergebnisoffen we need to happen .
if through the dialogue , and so i 'm going back to the point where , discussed this will , which scenarios for a area in question .
beteiligungsprozess heard , we’re going to ergebnisoffenheit itself .
and that as , if not from beginning , that is that the anstehende event like this and so it has , but on the experiences from the previous self-assembles .
what happens now , if citizens to your city will find and your city mitgestalten .
it 's already in numerous projects to see .
i picked up here 's a example from stadtacker , is the stuttgart , is an amputee , you so here 's known .
in new york was just a project launched , there 's hear a flussschwimmbad .
in anschieben einundvierzigtausend 're there of individuals within six weeks crowdfunding-kampagne dollars to come together the the funding possible to make or at 'ner .
the time has to spark in august wrote the public policy could n't think differently , as the idea to their own to make .
also the touristenmagnete in new york , to the i think i do n't need to tell , as it anymore to one of the high-line-park the city 's become was no idea of the politics or educational administration .
the contrary , the gleisanlagen for the abrisspläne were already .
in jena , so we 're going back in germany would have the citizens to plans to the very essence of it also again you .
the city was told bürgerbeteiligung is n't necessary .
the four weeks bürgerbeteiligung that we wish for bebauungsplan 'nen have , the rich than planauslage from .
today is the informationsseite the city offline .
during the side beteiligungsformate d e there it works and the city ideenwerkstätten that the initiative , the doc , set up and other mein-eichplatz supported .
so if the citizen reporting their own us on the streets .
in rotterdam in a crowdfunding-finanzierte over .
everything well as far , you want to say .
then we doing but now just so on .
but i think it for wrong , the city from the responsibility to them .
why ?
one thing , , because they have a look for all have or should have .
during the dedicated , it be the citizens of initiatives , or businesses in the rule on a for you in some form 's part of focus has the city , the responsibility for projects that dwell on the attention .
and to another part of course , even though the city in the projects are taking , are other way to provide .
a ehrenamtliche initiative the internet can only either side of priority .
also our goal was actually a temporary initiative that after her research had planned that was about half a year of the results and the responsibility to the city from those who wanted .
this was a big investor has the space in january of calendars .
it walk through negotiation .
so we have now in the problem that we the responsibility still not a could .
but we know , so this already now that , if the city is successfully beteiligungsprozess , if the negotiation in fact are successful that , then a zurückkauft be happening is .
in which to form of the landscape where is , frankly .
finally , to come i am convinced of that many projects that focuses on their meaning , complexity , or their costs of the city has evolved to be a chance to have any satisfaction on and she to create .
what if it on time and in dialogue with the citizens mitgestaltet be .
in each of town and citizens .
in each of town and you all that they do tonight is sitting here .
if we 're interested in and at the quality of the gestaltungswillen the citizens did n't even more than you can perceive , but as profitable .
this is it .
last night , the rehearsal , we were here in philosophieren in brauhaus and they are so the albstadt coming .
we have about how they spoke .
so this idea , still a second chance to have , if it in this life did n't really has , then just a second chance .
we found very exciting .
and we were but relatively quickly agree that it 's two things that there is n't we still see that we wanted .
this one is the puberty .
the second there was also sensitive to actually kind of the table , in the school ?
it .
it .
school , some of you remember , may still people out them .
in my place is it , twitter are now that schweißnassen years ago , but the words , i immediately to fünfundzwanzig hands .
my neck woman straps , working together and i just want to return on the loo .
and then i know not , how it on you was but in my exams was then always the studies the with the abschreiben-ist-verboten taken seriously , who sat beside me .
no idea what to go out of actually become interconnected .
they 're going to understand it , like , my school was really not beautiful and after i then my final abi-prüfung behind me do was completely clear , never again school .
and what do i now say , if i went on the year zweitausendvierzehn look back some of the most days that i spent , i in schools spent .
with great , and voluntarily .
how she came on that ?
like this happened ?
that just started to worry that something happens is , what i do n't even add it could .
i got kids .
so , my wife got the children .
and therefore i was then also very clear that you that 's the workforce , to these schulkram to take care .
to the one day , when they said , honey , it 's elternabend .
and today are you .
yes , elternabend .
because i opened the door and then i was sitting there kind of in this achtzigerjahre and that , but i was thrown back in the schulraum .
that looked like that looks like , how it back then we looked too .
and that , that , as , like school at as smelly , and i dacht ' gim me , human being here has time , really must be changed .
and when i then the teacher , say , and you know , the children learn not for the school , but to live there ausgehalten ' i did , oh my god , the sentence , i was n't dacht .
what is that , what we from high school , from this in fact , for life really take us have ?
so many of us have prüfungsangst there really well , learned .
where they 've actually in your life prüfungsangst hey , really well , need to ?
and may know some things , like the capital from yugoslavia .
what 's still better ?
or auskotzen , this ability in short time as much know in reinzustopfen , just so that i do it then on a again wissensbulimie can , until i 'm going ?
well , i realize that time needed for the bootsführerschein , but otherwise ?
and what 's telling a abi-schnitt from one point had one about whether someone to have a good doctor 's going ?
whether the empathic solution is and whether the good these properties ?
it .
so , no way , for life , not for the school we learn .
if we look back , so about achtzehnten years , the mid-20th zweihundertfuffzig century , feeling like that yes voted .
this is the time doing , germany in the schulpflicht then eventually i was introduced .
and where we also the educational system , how we it today , has its roots .
and if we have the time back then imagine , then it was actually so , the people at the had no access to know your time .
and there were these four or six years , the they basically what were forced to school . to go and with knowledge of that were then really the only way , the scene had to compete with the knowledge and the facts and the information their time in contact , to get .
today has a dreizehnjähriger more information in his pocket than the library of that time .
and the mid-20th achtzehnten century , that was the time the industrialization .
that means that there has a big changes in the world and there were suddenly people that these new machines were .
simultaneously , but also people that these machines to wait and repair could .
and we needed people , the these machines , could and the these factories were running .
maybe you realize it already .
that dreigliedrige school system , that we now in germany , you still have , has its root in this time .
and before a potentially make sense done .
also , because it back then probably really that was that , what i in school , there learned to the pursuit of the assembly line , you who the assembly line up , who stood there be for life .
do we 'nen look in the future .
we let that achtzehnte century , where it is , and we look at the year 20,000 .
this year we did was the year there was the first internetblase 're just about to pop .
i was with my have done , and thought , now is the time , now do you take on , the first company .
yes , after some of them to around me so with the internet , then probier ' i , then dacht ' i think that 's also now time .
and some of businesses are to self vorbeigekommen and bigger and and bigger , and we 're so beautiful slow grown , and some of the companies are then , give us again so in case vorbeigeschossen .
you see , makes two times in life .
and we had then after a few years has its staff .
so , we had so a beautiful growth and we had so interesting thing about careers on how app-entwickler , community-manager sounddesigner webdesigner .
i do n't know , whether you a concrete idea , what these people do but when i want to school . we had no idea that it so what ever would give them .
even when i abi did was from so what 's like the internet still do n't talk .
and the children that we wish today to school . send the job to the in 10 , six , twenty or 30 years , have ?
the only honest answer dadrauf we have no idea .
and which know , which facts are the to get us in those future jobs to succeed ?
and if you 're honest , also because the only answer , we have no idea .
and because we 've been so in the future looking at who could give me because the lottozahlen for the so there .
there 's 'nen it , i read .
well , you see , they have no idea .
how we can get then you out , what school for a 's lives learning ?
what are the things that we need to feed kids for life being fit to do ?
and maybe help so a look in in this , what companies today , they 're looking for .
that that are the abnehmer of school , yeah ?
the alumni from schools and universities are coming then in the company .
and if you , so a classic stellenanzeige at right , then it on , in the first yes , so what , how the expertise .
there are to the yes , so the reading , then so , we 're looking for berufserfahrung hochschulabsolventen fünfundzwanzigjährigen with 10 years 'nen and this traveled 12 years abroad .
that 's going to school right now , and also in the future ca n't afford .
what school , but maybe we could , are the things that always important to be , are the so called skills skills and i am convinced of life is that soft skills the hard soft the future will be .
and the you can basically , in three discrete groups to summarize .
this is one thing , , companies that employees , the flexible , are you is that one .
then that almost everybody freeze their employees with creative thinking .
and then that these are having employees , the teamfähig are .
so we have you will be thinking and work .
we start with the flexibility in .
this is relatively fast by understanding .
if we look , how economies , actually works , how fast , yes , how fast , everything is changing .
produktlebenszyklen , yes whole business models are affected by the internet of today , on this morning on the their head .
there practice , i employees , the with this change can deal .
there practice , i employees , the are creative .
there practice , i employees , the innovationsfähig are .
this is quite the exact opposite of what happened in the factory the end achtzehnten century of employees feel the assembly line it had .
also the second issue that there thinking is quite clear .
there 's hear the responsibility .
there 's hear people , the take responsibility .
first time for example , and their own life .
but also for that telescope .
whether this now the company is , or , as a society that we humans the take responsibility for that telescope .
and the third factor , the things that will almost the number one do .
and when we 're going to the football world cup remember , then there 's because the internet , this beautiful saying .
there has ronaldo messi portugal , has 'nen and germany has a team .
it was n't lahm , which the world has gained .
that were able to the only in common to create .
and this , somebody , this big impact our time , steve jobs , yes , hochgelobt .
it was not the answers , the iphone , invented has , who has not the imac invented , who has a n't invented , who has nothing about being invented .
the had a team that this possible has done , because just as a team who could do that what they 've done .
so a school , the these three things in teaching her , that if only a school , when we for a 's lives learning .
but there 's still 'nen fourth point , and it 's me almost , even more .
and this is the learning itself .
if the only , what we about the future with safety can tell is that they do this is then it this is the ability , again and new to learn and fun doing this to have this learning to experience the true to mess we in later life , and that our children in later life are successful .
that if only a school , the these things that .
but where i was ?
i was sitting in this vergnügungssteuer and the of them , the kids have to be able to know , that 's not just a wonderful event is , for the you elternabend to pay .
so a wonderful event , after the slogan of all it said , but there 's not from each other .
up to the moment , where elternvertreter 're elected , there are then suddenly all of invisible .
yes , i was sitting there and what do i say , and i elternabende of my kids were these schullaufbahn still the funniest parts of the event .
less fun , it was for me as the world , as if so the stress around the subject of homework and learn the entire family life runterzieht .
and still less fun makes it , when the kid who will , because in school , stress .
and finally ended up these elternabend or was a peak of schullaufbahn , at this school also again so 'n schullaufbahn .
and in fact , it was also not elternnachmittag , it was rather like a elternabend , so thing to the last one hour and in fact , we were also the single parents , the were invited .
and i erspar you now , and also told me the detail by the time after the time that i was clear , we need to our child , figure out , this is n't .
vorangegangen but are two years , where we do n't have given that works even just not .
what do we really wrong ?
and we had fallen in fact , the question put that 's our child is broken ?
and we are the only , where it that 's about ?
now i in the last two years , since i fell in the subject i 'm involved with very many people talked and that , it . i 've learned , you 're not alone .
out there are very many , where it very similar to go and that was two years ago , because i sat with jürgen one together we were just , a new business to reasons , have to us about , where the journey because she goes , and night , we sat , the bar and have us about private things be exchanged .
and what do i say , he has to me almost the same story with a his kids , he has almost the same thing i 'd seen how we , and we had the good luck that we our children , figure out were from high school , yeah ?
in berlin , there 's one hand , a riesenauswahl different schools and we could even people in to consider .
but can that everyone do out there ?
somehow was us that to little bit , simply our children in safety to , and that it can turn out there be that way to let me , what they are .
and after we both right now the impression that had to school , there has since we were there is not so really changed , we thought , yeah well , we 're the first , the topic that now attack .
just , how shall we as quereinsteiger there anything or change ?
the good thing is that we be deceived yourself .
we 're not alone .
but we have a relatively fast as a whole range of amazing people found that what you wanted to the point , which is a school , create the following everybody who lived up going .
it 's not so that only the children and their parents lying under the suffering , what out there are often happens .
if we the teachers look , 30 percent of the teachers have burnout .
if we look , to make the number krankheitstage in the last 10 years has changed the , there has doubled .
it can now , that all parents what do ?
that all children dying and that those teachers broken we are ?
or it be that we have a school system , that simply not more like this fits , like this fünfundzwanzig ago hochzeitsanzug years , the fit just as well , is not so right .
and we have many people found , where it gets that went and we have even people found that do n't have children .
and they 've understood that they take responsibility to for the future that they take responsibility to for the future , by showing you take responsibility for that , what we our children , my kids , the now to school . go to hang on the way to give them .
and we 've gotten to leuchtturmprojekte second gotten there 's out there a whole range of like you have initiatives , the school want to change , and there 's there 's vorbildliche schools , here and there really cool thing 'ner and there 's almost every school teachers that actually committed and something want to change .
and there 's even the a or other as principal , then also traut the first step to go .
and how we should now as quereinsteiger help ?
we had no concept that we now about helping us could .
but we can make one do , we can in those schools go and we can in these schools in the people , the school is , so the parents , the teachers and the students , we connect and we can with which in two days a whole lot of moving .
there are so people together , the in the past , so each have worked and the learning in two days , what it 's have been able to work .
the come with 'ner it challenge of them together to solve .
and after two days have the then , for a new leitbild developed sooner or the gun given for a totally new school as we 're in berlin school right now be allowed to .
or the concrete things for on problems that they do in your school , to have evolved .
of individuals within two days after all evolved to find that the next day , which can be .
what but that this is said , what these two days happens , and that makes it for me then so beautiful the few weekends , the i have him , and then also , and schools in germany to spend , is that energy that there is when the three things to learn .
if the three things together to experience , because , what about how you were .
so we kind of their thinking and , when you as a team of creativity .
then , is this a spark in fact , etc. .
and if we are four weeks after that 'nem workshop , so a school principals come back then we ever know that , in the school as a whole has been , to change that there are a totally new culture .
and this is incredible hot .
and i möcht they invite you about a school to think .
i möcht they invite , flying school thinking .
and i möcht they all , also said , about , flying school , to talk .
talk about that , what you like but talk they also that , what you do n't like .
they will be surprised how much , for you get and how many people the same have seen , but just not talking about .
you make us do you make us on every school in germany , einundzwanzigste century .
you make us the entire system in change .
and you make us this together do with the people the school day for a day off , with the parents , the teachers and the students .
because it collectively we can do this .
thank you .
