when steve lopez , at the los angeles times , one day through the streets in the center of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
they came from a man , an african-american , how likable , rough , and homeless , the on a violin , the last , two strings .
many of you 're going to the story know , because of juilliard-konservatorium article about it was later a book , that , they became , robert downey junior varsity when steve lopez , jamie kontrabassisten as a anthony ayers , the foxx , the steves studied and the very promising a very early by his paranoid schizophrenia was ended .
nathaniel left school , a skid and 30 years later lived there it as homeless man on the streets of nervenzusammenbruch row in the center of los angeles .
i recommend you all , mithalf book to read , from the film to watch , you to not just the wonderful about interconnection , understand the between these two men 's , but also , how the music that link to helping and how they finally the instrument was , when that that allows is that steves , a way of the street to get one .
i met this mr concert back in 2008 , two years ago , in the walt disney ayers hall .
he had just a demo of through the first and now be heard and i get behind the stage to me , me to imagine .
he talked in a very tückischen and to tone of yo-yo ma , hillary clinton , and about how the dodgers abandoned it never in the baseball world series of creating a result . and that all because the heiteren passage of violin at the last sentence of is really symphony .
we came to talk about music to talk . and a few days later i get an email , in the status that was for a beacon with me interested .
i have to mention that was a medical practice called , because he was already with an electrical shocks and with thorazin and you have been treated , a trauma , that it be whole life .
as a result of this is he now , especially vulnerable to these these stages . that are sometimes that bad , and he for days away , in the streets of folterqualen row herumwandert , always this horror and the skid of his own mind to .
and in just as a concert was very , when we do with our first of class in the walt disney reizstadium hall , started . he had this 'm wrong flickering in his eyes and this seemed completely lost .
he talked about the invisible demons and smoke , and about how someone in their poison wanted .
i was afraid , do n't know , but i was afraid that i find him lose that might notice that he in one of his if they could and that i told him its relationship to have you could , if i started , about geigenpädagogik and didaktischen and other thing forms of the arpeggios tonleitern talking .
i started -- so easy to play .
i was playing the first set of snippet violinkonzert .
and while i was playing , i noticed that in nathaniels eyes a , in existential question , went .
it was , as if he under the impact of an invisible have to catch up , a chemical response , the catalyst my game was .
manischer nathaniels has morphed into blocks , understanding , in a calm and there .
and the way through a miracle , he took his violin and began to be heard some clips from sibelius to play and asked me then , you to end to play : tschaikowski , mendelssohn , violinkonzerten .
we started , about music to talk , starting from the stream of beethoven , salonen , esa-pekka and all the other 's , of bartók to bruckner brahms .
and i became clear that he 's not just a ever know about music owned , but it with you also a strong personal relationship on there .
he spoke of her with a passion and a deeper understanding that anything else i just from my colleagues in the , from los angeles to know .
by he music playing and about music that was was out of this ausgezeichneter , confused man , the men 's still going through the streets of los angeles , was , a little , gebildeter , paranoiden , in doing with musicians have become .
music is medicine . music , changes us .
for a means that music involves thinking about health .
because the music it allows him , his thoughts , and with the help his imagination and creativity in a real to aspire .
and so entflieht he is being .
i want to understand that this : that the essence of art is .
exactly this is , the reason why we music : so we do something that in us all , deep in the inside , our feelings , through our artistic lens , through our creativity to the fact , shape can .
and the fact that expression of us all , and moves , inspired by and that unites us .
what a way , like that brought him the music back in a community of friends .
the erlösende force the music that brought him back in a family of musicians , the mind that might be there was to and so .
and i 'm going , of a music , no matter whether in the walt disney skid hall , or in concert row , because he this reminds me , why i brought musicians have become am .
thank you .
bruno giussani : thank you . thanks .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play , that i unverschämterweise the one stolen .
i hope that you pardon me .
so i have in my life of smelly fish have argued .
i only two loved .
this first , this was more like a passionate them .
it was a fish , gehaltvoll good , it , wohlschmeckend , a best-selling book on the menu .
what for a fish .
even better , he was in aquakultur after the supposedly doing is standards of sustainability from .
you could make , so i feel about that , him to sell it .
i had with this beauty of a relationship of several months .
one day -- called the head of the company , and she said , whether i at an event you could about the sustainability in the farm .
`` course , '' i said .
here was a company that leads to solve was trying to what this incredible problem for our chefs is . how do we fish on our menus ?
in the last 50 years we have the oceans for how we and following : have .
it 's hard , the destruction began to change .
ninety percent of the big fish , the that we love , the example , the heilbutte , the salmon , this , they 're totally collapsed .
it 's almost nothing more left .
so will probably disney or address fischanbau , aquakultur , a part of our future .
lots of arguments against it . fischzuchtanlagen pollute the environment , the most of them anyway , and they are inefficient , we take these tuna . a big disadvantage .
he has a futterverwertung of 15 to one .
that is , 15 pounds of wild fish are required to kind of you a zucht-thunfisch get .
not very sustainable .
they’re not very good .
so here was finally one company , the tried , it right to make .
i wanted you have .
the day , the event i called the head of the public for the company .
we call him , don .
`` clear don brownlee , '' i said , `` just with the facts , right to have , you 're fabulously famous for it , so far out in the sea of that their the environment , not been messing up . ''
`` that 's true , '' he said . `` we 're so far out that the waste of our fish will , not focused . ''
and then put it , `` we 're essentially , in a own world .
these 2.5 of futterverwertung to one , '' he said .
`` the best in the industry . ''
2.5 to one , great .
`` 2.5 to be one of what ? what she said , you ? ''
`` what proteins , '' he said .
`` great , '' i said . put on .
and that night , i lay in bed and thought , what the hell 's a sustainable protein ?
so i called the next day , , just before the event , don brownlee , .
i said , don brownlee , what example , are sustainable proteins right ? ''
he said , he had her not . he 'll go .
now , i was with a few people in the company . nobody could tell me a 's answer to give them . until i finally began with the senior biologists on .
we call him , don .
`` clear don brownlee , '' i said , `` what example , are sustainable proteins right ? ''
well , he mentioned some algae and some hühnchen-pellets , and then he said , fischmehle .
i said , `` hühnchen-pellets ? ''
he said , `` yes , putting feathers , skin , getrocknet , but , knochenmehl and to forage data . ''
i said , `` how much percent of the , is chicken ? `` well ,
in the assumption of maybe two percent .
`` well , that are about 30 percent , '' he said .
i said , don brownlee , what 's sustainable , chicken , fish to feed ? ''
there 's a long break in the leadership and he said , `` there 's simply too much to chicken in the world . ''
i entliebte me of this fish .
no , not , because i a gutmensch genießer and selbstgerechter am .
that i 'm even .
no , i 've entliebt , they actually this fish micht , because , i swear to god , the fish , this entertainment , you know .
this second fish , that 's a different kind of love story .
it 's the romantic sort of , the way , and you , the better to his fish no idea of learning , you the fish the more love .
i told him first in a restaurant in südspanien eaten .
a single a had been thinking about of this fish talked about .
you think that has a set .
he came on the table with a light , almost his white color .
the had him verkocht .
, twice .
amazingly , he was still , delicious .
who can a fish that well , taste , after he verkocht ?
i ca n't it , but this guy can it .
we call him for . actually means he miguel sokoloff .
and no , he has the fish are not a cook and he is not . at least on the way that you and i have to understand .
he 's a biologist in palma veta .
that 's a südwestlichen in the fischaufzucht corner of spain .
it 's near the guadalquivir the river mündung .
until in the 1980s was the farm in the hands of argentiniern .
they 're domesticated fleischrinder on the time , which essentially , in wetlands .
they did that , it by the country entwässerten .
they built this complicated , of sewers , and they were water from the land out and out in the river .
well , they could n't make that was fine , not benefiting economically .
and ecologically it was a catastrophe .
it brought about 90 percent of the birds , what kind of this many birds are .
and so in a spanish company with green bought that land .
what they 've done ?
they have the river of the water , and vice versa .
they have literally the lever on .
instead of the water hereinzuziehen they used the channels , the water again herauszudrängen .
they fluteten the channels .
they created a thousand meeräsche -- barsch , fischaufzucht , shrimp , that -- and , you have miguel , and his company the environmental destruction , vice versa .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , they have thought that was still never seen .
you stare out on the horizon , the one million miles away is , and everything what you 're geflutete channels and these density , lush marches .
i was there is n't long time with miguel sokoloff .
he 's a sense of guy , three parts of charles darwin and a part `` a crocodile , kissing . ''
okay ? there we were and she fought alongside us through the wetlands and i biologievorlesung and schwitze , have to have to put my travels down , and for holding in peace one keuche .
here 's he 's a rare gleitaar .
now i said before he the mineralbedürfnisse of phytoplankton .
and here , here he looks a pattern of these problems that 's him , the tanzanian giraffes are reminiscent of .
it turns out , that for most of his career in mikumi national park in africa has spent .
i asked him , he , to be so a fisch-experten 's become .
he said , `` fish ? i do n't know about fish .
i 'm a world-renowned expert on for those relationships . ''
and then he goes and it blocks , more about of those birds and algae and weird wasserpflanzen .
and understand it 's not me wrong , this was really fascinating , you know , the biotic community unplugged , so in the way .
it 's great , but i was in love .
and my head was really about this verkochte piece of fish that i just the brink had .
so i put him off . i said , `` miguel , how is it , that your fish that well taste ? ''
he showed on the algae .
`` i know , boy , the algae , of phytoplankton , the relationships , this is incredible .
but what eat your built-in fish ?
how is the futterverwertung ? ''
well , he drives me to share that it might be a rich system is , the fish caught eating , which it in the wild food .
the point in the , phytoplankton , the zooplankton , this is it , what the fish that she feeds .
the system is so healthy , it 's completely selbsterneuernd .
there 's no food .
the more of a farm heard that pummel their animals not a ?
later , the day i went on this site , for around and i asked him , i said , `` to a place , the course it seems to be , '' different than any rural farm , on the i ever been was , `` how much it ? ''
in the moment , it was , as if a clean a bühnenwechsel to have .
and we must bow to the corner and we provided the most incredible sight , and thousands pinker flamingos , a literally his carpet that far the eye can see .
`` that 's success , '' he said .
`` look at their bellies on , and pink .
they schlemmen . ''
schlemmen ? i was a very much .
i said , `` miguel , schlemmen they do n't fish ? ''
`` yes , '' he said .
`` we 're lost 20 percent of our fish and fischeiern going to the birds .
well , last year were on this site in birds , more than 250,000 interesting ways .
it is today the largest and one of the key to private vogelreservate in europe , become .
i said , `` miguel , is a good fischaufzucht vogelbestand not the last thing that you on a gedeihender have to ? ''
he did his head , no .
he said , `` we build extensiv adapt , and deal .
this is a great network .
the reason to eat the shrimp .
the , you 'll eat the phytoplankton .
ever thought so the belly of the better the system . ''
okay , you make us that has come . a farm , the animals not a and a farm , the their success , had the health of being able to measure .
a vogelreservat , but also a fischaufzucht .
oh , and the way to these flamingos , which is not even be there .
they breed in a city in miles away , where the surface is better for the work .
every morning they fly in a farm .
and every night they fly in two miles back .
they do that because they the a92 white line the highway gestrichelten follow .
seriously .
i had been sort of the journey of the penguins had imagined , so i did look for .
i said , `` miguel , they fly in many kilometers to the farm and they go then in two miles back on the evening ?
they do that for the children ? ''
he looked at me , as if i just a song from the houston , quotes .
he said , `` no . they do that because the food is better . ''
i did n't the skin of my beloved of a fish mentioned that is was , and i do n't like sautiert . i like they do n't fischhaut . i like they do n't rise .
it is that one , verkohlte flavor .
i 'm cooking , almost never seen it .
and yet , when i want you in this restaurant in fischhaut that has it does n't even after südspanien you .
they did sweet and in the thing , as if you a half bites the ocean would take .
i mentioned that for and he kind .
he said , `` the skin does a , i swam .
it is the last areas , before something in the body to .
it has evolved over the evolution has evolved to unreinheiten suck up . ''
and then after he said , but our drinking water has no unreinheiten . ''
okay . a farm , the your fish do n't she feeds . a farm , the their success is measuring the success of its predators .
and then i realized , when he says , a farm , the no guadalquivir has , untertreibt it , because the water , that through this farm is coming out of the river unreinheiten in .
it 's a river , the all the things with them , leads , which are rivers are now tend to bring them with them , to lead , chemical pollutants , all of schädlingsbekämpfungsmitteln .
and if it , through the system -- and this leaves is the waters clean , as soon as it hereingekommen is .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
so not just a farm , the animals not a , not just a farm , the their success , had the health of being able to measure , but a farm , the literally a wasser-aufbereitungsanlage is , and not just for these fish , but also for you and me .
because if the water versinkt , herausfließt it in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i take him , and that they to do it also , because these love story , like this , you name is also telling .
you might argue that you , a recipe is for the future of good food , whether we of fleischrindern or barsch talk .
what we need , is a radical new concept of agriculture , from one , in the food was actually good , taste .
but for many people like this is a little to radically changed .
we 're not a realist -- , we genießer . we 're lover .
we love familienbetriebe . we love little wochenmärkte . we 're talking about local food . we eat food .
and if they claim that the things are , not the future of good food that 's somebody somewhere on and says , `` hey guys , i love pink flamingos , but how they will feed the world ?
how they will feed the world ? ''
i would be honest ?
i like this question is not .
no , not , because we already nearly enough calories , the world more than just to feed .
a billion people are today with .
a billion -- that 's more than ever before -- because krasser back in the distribution , not the gas emissions .
well , i like this question is not , because they the logic of our nahrungssystems the last 50 years about .
on corn , but , schädlingsbekämpfungsmittel monocultures , chemicals , the earth , chicken , fish , and all the time has the developed just wondered : `` if we 're more people less feed , how can it be ? ''
this was the , . it was the equivalent . it was the plan that the american agriculture .
we should they call , which it is , a whole industry formed in abwicklung , a whole industry , the ground fast about capital intensive care , the fact , the production system that .
this is not if , and it is n't agriculture .
our abnehmender today is threatened , not because zufuhr abnehmender , but because kornkammer resources ,
not by the latest traktor-erfindungen and mähdrescher- , but through , country , not by the pumps , but through fresh water , not by chainsaws , but through the forests , and not by doing and nets , but through the fish in the sea .
they want to feed the world ?
let it 's start with the question : how we going to feed itself ?
or better , how we can to create that every community to enable , singing to feed ?
to bring that do , you look not on the agrarindustrie-modell for the future .
it 's really old , and it 's done .
capital , chemistry and machines are in it obenan and it has never been something really good , for food produced .
we look , the model depends .
this is that , that on two billion years about himself .
you look for instance , farmers how miguel ,
businesses , the worlds for example , which are , businesses , the kind of the inflationary theory , businesses , the extensiv growing some rather than just hard , farmers , the not just too are , but experts for those relationships ,
because they are ones that experts to flavor .
and when i really honestly 'm sure you 're a better than i do it ever be going .
you know , that 's me , because if that the future of good food is , it will be .
thank you .
if i do you today one thing going to it is that the totality of the data that we consume , bigger than it is the sum of bits and instead , informationsüberladung to think i want to that you think about how we information that can use that , patterns and we so we actually realize that otherwise would n't have been visible , which are .
so , what we see here 's a typical sterbediagramm age of .
the program , that i here , is a little experiment .
it 's called pivot and what i do with pivot can do is that i after a certain death will filter that you can say we crashes .
and instantly i see a different patterns . east-northeast also .
and it changes , because in gebrechlichsten here in the people at the most are and they over here at the mittelbereich are .
we can a step further out and reorganize the data , and see that kreislauferkrankungen and cancer the usual suspects , but not for everyone .
so if we go and after an old man , we say , 40 years or a younger , we see that 's even the leading cause is about the , the people are going to start thinking .
and who weiterforscht see that 's especially in men 's true .
you see so that look of information and data in this way , strongly swimming in a living informationsgrafik reminds us .
and if we this for raw data can do n't , the content in itself ?
what we now , there are the front of every single `` because illustrated '' that has ever in print .
it 's all over here . it 's everything online .
they can it would like , my talk in their rooms to test .
with pivot can you have them in a decade .
they can have them in a particular year .
you can go directly to a particular type of jumping .
now if i here , i look , i see the athletes , the homes in the copy appear and the sports .
i 'm a lance armstrong fan , so i click to here , all tell me to show in which lance armstrong mentioned will .
now , if i just a gröberen of getting to , i could think `` ok , what if i keep everything with the subject of walking to look back ? ''
so i go back a and erweitere of view .
now i see greg lemond .
and so you get an idea , that there , asked this kind of information on , so , , rauszoomen , reinzoomen , then you look for you do n't or target is not just .
you make something that actually a little bit different is .
it 's something between , and we think it changes the way that way , how information can be used .
i want to this idea now a little further do with about what a little crazy is .
what we 've done is , we have every single wikipediaseite , and they 're going on a little summary reduced .
the summary of a short in and a symbol of the area of it comes .
i 'm just the top , especially in the most popular wikipediaseiten .
but even in this -- this view , we can get lots of things do .
immediately , we get a sense of the themes that focuses on wikipedia , the popular ones are .
so i 'm the issue 'regierung vote .
well , after i wikipediakategorien elected , i know that the 'regierung the workforce , the most so , `` time magazine called `` people the year '' are .
this is really important , because this an insight is that do n't in a single wikipediaseite .
that 's just to see if you one step back and the entire at them .
are on a particular kind of zusammenfassungen i can then in the theme `` time magazine called `` people the year '' in to go , and all together to see .
now if i all these people consider you know what i that most of musikbereich are . some people come from the science . some , still less , come from the economy . here is my boss . and one comes from the regierungsbeamte .
and interestingly , is , also a ted prize winner .
so we can jump , and a view on all of ted prize winner .
you see , we 're surfing on the net the first time as if it also really a net is , not only from side to side , but how much more abstract .
and so i want to you what else to show what a little surprise could be .
i 'll show you here just the new york times website .
zoom-technologie , this app -- i want to it 's not a browser . it 's really not a browser , but you can websites to look -- and we bring these pivot to every single website as this .
so i can one step back , and directly to a specific setness of jumping .
that 's why most important , because you just through that look out of websites , at the way and way , all the internet-verlauf on the same way and way at the universe .
so i can not in my and zoom in a certain time .
here 's the status of the u.s. and that i want to go this .
and i can , everything , what today i 've been considered , back .
and , if i go back one step in and on all look , i can mean that happened -- perhaps my pivot . here , i 've been , 'nepotistisch ' `` for , here , bing , right here to live in such-vergangenheit .
and from here i can in the side to get inside and again , they bring up .
it 's a metaphor , the way , that 's spent , and every time it makes the overall picture than the sum of the data .
the moment , in this world , we think that data a curse .
we talk from the one of the informationsüberflusses .
we 're talking about the `` drowning in information . ''
what if we this situation where i could and the internet on the head , so that we instead of a to another to go to start of many things to many things go to have , and it creates pattern of see , what otherwise it has never be ?
if we can do , there will be of datenfalle , maybe a new source make more information .
and , rather than just in information to move , can we know that tell you get .
and if we know experience , then we can maybe even the wisdom of them down .
so i hear on , thank you .
i grew up with a you helping science fiction .
in my high school i went with the bus to college , every day an hour .
and my nose was always in a book , a erzählerische , that my mind in other worlds entführte and on science-fiction-buch way deep in me up , this voracious , .
these are also know , that i always , if i 'm not in school , was , through the forests teichwasser , , and `` samples collected , frogs and snakes and this company and streunte , all home , and under the microscope at .
i was totally wissenschaftsbegeistert , you know .
it was so , the trial , the world to understand and the boundaries of the .
and my love to science fiction seemed lifelike , in my environment of , because then , in the late '60s , we went to the moon and were exploring the deep .
jacques cousteau came in our living with his chief ways it shows that we animals and places and a whole world of miracle that we 'd never have to imagine .
that has then i would also very good to the gepasst science-fiction-rolle .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and because it does n't play video still these übersättigung with computer-generated performance of , you all the imagery in the media , there , i had to the images in my head create .
that we had at all . if we as kids a book to read , we took the description of the author and projected needs them on the screen in our heads .
my response to that was the drawing and draw from alien , the worlds , robots , futuristic , and all that .
in math class . i was constantly frightened by the teachers get caught , as i , the textbook was hidden , herummalte .
the creativity to wait a way out .
and he was done something interesting . what makes me is a lot of cousteaus what they were intrigued , was the idea , a completely unseen world here on our earth itself .
surely , i would never an alien world with a spaceship . that appeared to me pretty unlikely .
but here was a world that i actually enter could , here on the earth , and it was as fascinating and they like all this , what i always had imagined , when i these books had read .
so i decided , when i was 15 , every note .
the only problem was that i was in a small village in canada lived , one over 12,000 miles away from the next ocean away .
and i but not willing .
i kind of my father , until he finally one tauchschule in place , new york , who had made , right on the other side of the border , where we lived .
i made my ymca in a pool of the tauchschein out in the winter winds in place , new york .
the ocean but , with a real ocean , i got only two years later to face , when we decide , california to flat .
since , in the 40 years , the story are , i spent about three hours , underwater spent . 500 hours of them in tauchbooten .
and i 've learned that the world the deep , even in the faszinierendem oceans , so rich , flacheren life is , how we let 's really hardly anyone can imagine .
the realm of nature knows , no borders , very , as opposed to our own , kläglichen human imagination .
until the world today days i feel that deepest awe , for that , what i have on my early dives , and see .
and my love to the ocean is looking at her , with the same intensity as well , and the .
when i realized then as an adult encountering a profession filmemachen , it was that aussuchte .
that seemed the best way , my inner drive , stories to share with my desire for , images to create , to unite .
as a kid who drew i constantly comic books and so .
so were the way to pictures and stories from . that fit together .
of course , was the stories that i abyss , from the science fiction , `` the terminator , '' `` aliens , '' and `` aussuchte . ''
`` filmemachen '' i could my penchant for the yourself and that with the abyss connect .
so intertwined of my two passions .
something interesting happened in `` cg '' : to a wasserwesen problem in this film to solve -- did , and we had this kind of liquid erzählerisches create -- , you 're going on and animation , abyss , back .
what it ends up , was the first , and soft-surface-figur , the ever in a movie , to see was .
the film is no money , just said he played , just about his was a , but i noticed an amazing thing : the audience around the world was like the magic that the kind of it was initiated .
according to arthur clarke 's law 're going fortgeschrittliche technology and to do n't operate , to tell them .
they saw so something magic .
and that i found it 's incredibly exciting .
and then i thought , `` wow , this must have done in the region be involved . ''
so we went in `` look at two , '' my next movie , still much further .
together with ilm and we there the guy from liquid metal . the success was one , , like this effect that would .
and it worked . again , we had something magic is created . and the effect in the audience was the same . but we have with the movie ever been a little bit more money eingespielt .
of these two experiences from , was a new world , a new world of creativity for filmschaffende .
so i started a company , along with my good friend with stan winston studio , the to speak at the best domain and creature-designer was . she was called `` digitally make-up- . ''
the main idea of this company was it , the stage and processes with it also , etc . to skip ahead and the same with digital produktionen to begin .
that we do then , and -- gave us as a while a competitive advantage .
but the '90s years we realized that we in vorankamen and character-design -- what we get the company , yes , basically founded -- to slow creature- .
i had this piece `` computational avatar , '' written with that it in terms of visual effects and cg effects in new heights of should have , but human , , characters , the cg links that were essentially . and the hauptfiguren should all cg be . and the world ought to computergenerierter be .
but the very put stuff back . and the people in my company that told me that we go still not in the ability to be too , that to create .
so let 's i do that and made this was another movie about the big ship , that goes down .
the liebesfilm i have the as `` romeo and on a ship '' she sells . it was a filmstudio made out , a passionate about film .
secretly , but i wanted to the real thing up the titanic to immerse ourselves .
it 's why i have the film did .
this is the truth . the studio knew that but not .
i have it but i convinced , by i said , `` we 're going to the cover up . we continue filming the actual up .
we 're going to it in the eröffnungssequenz of the movie show .
this is hugely important . it is a good -- for marketing . ''
and i überredete you , an expedition to finance .
sounds crazy . but that goes back to that that the own imagination a reality we can actually create .
we then created in fact , six months later a reality , when i fell in a russian bullauge end , four kilometers from the surface of the north atlantic , and me the real titanic through a tauchboot the .
that was not a movie , not a high definition , that was real .
so , that has really amazes me just blew .
and the preparation you were enormous . we had to give cameras and light and all sorts of building .
and i noticed , as they very these weltraummission , a tiefseetauchgänge were similar .
well , they were also umfangreicher and once required hochtechnisch planning .
you ascend up in these capsule , which you in this dark , hostile environment down , where no hope , saving is , if you ca n't it yourself back to do .
and then i thought , `` wow , that 's as well , as if i was in a whale was .
this is really cool . ''
i was really obsessed by the study the deep .
anyway of one of this that with curiosity and science has to do . it was all . it was an adventure , it was a curiosity . it was an imagination .
and it was an experience , me to do n't give you could .
because , you know , i could be a creature imagine , for that we then a visual on land could . but i could n't that 's imagine , what i outside the idea would see .
in some sort of the next to have i beings in thermalquellen seen , and sometimes , things that i still never seen before had the psyche , things that nobody ever seen before had and for that science , when , when we they saw , actually , no words had found .
that has me so really transformative , and i wanted more .
and so i met then it on a particular decision .
after the success of `` titanic '' i said , `` okay , i want to my vollzeit-forscher as a filmmaker , in hollywood goes on ice , and let me for a while hauptberuf . ''
and then we started , we showed up to `` feet , '' and they were exploring with roboterfahrzeugen .
we returned to cover up the titanic transition back .
we took little robot that we built , the a abwickelten fiberglaskabel .
our intention was , hineinzutauchen and the inside and to watch , what 's ever been done was biking .
nobody had ever the inside that explores . they were still no means that . so we evolved the necessary technology .
well , and there , i 'm now , on the deck of the titanic , in a brettern , and see planken that these tauchboot here 's quite similar and of which i know that once the band playing .
and i was with a small roboterfahrzeug through the change the ship .
i do it 's actually just , but my mind is within the vehicle .
it felt , as if i exercise within the schiffswracks the titanic there .
that was the most surreal of filmset that i ever have experienced . because before i each one corner on , you know , i always , what in lichtkegel the vehicle of dignity , because i conducted months déjà-vu the was , when we the film has been around .
that set was which is an exact replica the design of the ship .
so that was a highly the experience .
they made me this roboterhafte realized that you can have this telepräsenz-erlebnis you use and so that own consciousness in the vehicle , in these different form of existence embarrassed .
it was really profound
and may also a brief clip , that , what perhaps in a few decades could happen , if you science-fiction-fan has to something to explore or other things to do , in all sorts of zukunftszenarios post-humanen that i want me as cyborg-körper imagine .
after this mounting expeditions we started , that , what we 're going down there had seen , really appreciate , to do for example , these tiefseequellen , where we these incredibly amazing animals . that are sort of space aliens , but here on earth .
they live with help of life .
they 're not in a on , we system , how we do that .
and so you see animals , the next to a 500 degrees celsius for you to survive there can .
the same time in i also very much for science-fiction-einfluss , that was again the weltraumwissenschaft from my childhood .
and so i ended up in the guys at the workforce , for the space were interested and the with the nasa have to do and in 3d-kamerasysteme and sitting right weltraumstation planning . you continue to russia , through the mission that this is killed , everything you , and it , then joined the international weltraummissionen and take our nasa-sachverständigenrat with .
that was fascinating .
but the end it was rather on beyond that i weltraumwissenschaftler with us in the deep .
i took them with and planetenwissenschaftler you access to the world down there : astrobiologen , verschaftte , people the workforce , for such extreme conditions in . i took them to the sources with , so you look around , where they take and instruments , could and so forth .
we turned it changes in documentary , run , but actually science , more specifically , weltraumwissenschaft .
so the fact , the circle between my existence as science-fiction-fan , then as a child , and the and in the reality .
, in this as i have a lot of learned .
i have a lot about science learned . but i now you think , surely a director also have to lead , to be a leader be like a schiffskapitän or so .
i understood but not a lot of leadership skills , i do this mounting expeditions antrat .
because , a particular point i had to say , `` what do i actually here ?
why i 'm doing that ? what comes out of it ? ''
the stinking movies tend to bring us no money .
we play time on the was a . of fame not a lane .
all think , i was between `` titanic '' and `` computational avatar , '' davongelaufen and have told me a car in the 'm on one towel the beach tweaked her .
i 've all these films , this one , for a very small audience did .
not a fame , not an honor , no money . what are you just ?
you 're doing it to the task , by telling the challenge will -- and the ocean is the have an environment that there 's . you 're doing it the entdeckerrausches because , and because the funny connection , the creation is , if a small group of people a team is .
because we have all this with only 10 to 12 people did , the years , broadcasting 've been . sometimes we were two to three months after a row on sea .
and in this community you realize that the most important thing the language is that you make each has , because you a task . that you make any other that can explain .
if you land back and says , `` we had to do it , this fiberglass , the schallschwächung , and the very vague idea , the whole technology , and the trouble , the human need , if you on the differences . '' , then you can the other just do n't explain . that 's so , like a police or in ] soldiers , the something together have gone through and to know , it 's never meet somebody can explain .
there is a connection to , and within each other respect .
so when i came back to my next film `` computational avatar , '' to turn , i tried the managing to , which is referred to be a respected and in return to respect , deserves .
it was the dynamics really changed .
i stood there so again with a small team on a kind of rough terrain . we were about `` computational avatar with a new technique that it before , but not there .
it 's incredibly exciting .
an enormous challenge .
and we were for a period of four years to a right family .
it changed my way , movies , to do , completely .
it was giving people that they said , we have these ozeanwesen really good at this and on the planet 's to low .
for me , it was more a prinzipielle way , my job to do , the actual process , in the result has changed .
what we can so from all of close ?
the lessons we 've learned ?
i think , in the first letter is the curiosity .
it 's the most human property .
our imagination is a force that even a reality we can actually create .
and the warning of your team is more than all lorbeer this world .
come to me kid , filmmaker , the say , `` you give me a advice , as i thought that can do . ''
and i say , `` schränke n't even a .
that get some other for you . do it does n't even infect , she 'll do n't want to kill themselves . but take risks on you . ''
the nasa has been so a lieblingssatz , `` failure is not an alternative . ''
but in the art and on the study has to fail as an alternative to be , because there will guarantee it 's a giant leap .
no big endeavor , that innovation for at , was ever done without risk being addressed .
you have to be ready , these risks on to take .
that 's the idea , who i them to participate in the to leave . failure is quite an alternative , fear but is no . thanks .
today i 'm going to you about energy and climate .
and that surprise , maybe something that , because my vollzeitbeschäftigung in the foundation mainly due to -- and seed is to get the things that we make them , and deliver to the poorest two billion a better life to get there .
but energy and climate are extremely important for those people , in fact , even more than for each other on the planet .
saaten means that their klimaverschlechterung over many years not to grow . it we 're going to a lot sooner or to hell of rain . the things are so change , how it their fragile environment is not withstand a button .
this leads to hungersterben . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to this .
so , is a climate change , terrible for you will .
and there 's the energiepreis for you very important .
the fact is that , what if it from one thing the price down , to armutsverringerung would energy in far beyond the most effective .
well , the energiepreis is about the time like .
actually based on the energiefortschritten on fortschrittsgesellschaft .
the elektrizitätspreis towards the industrial revolution , and even the 20th century , there 's a rapid transition case in kohlerevolution and why we 've know , climate control , we can modern composite materials and so many things do .
we are so in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but , if we the price down -- we let us the price in half -- we meet on a new barrier and this barrier to do with carbon together .
co2 is the planet and the equation for carbon is actually pretty clear .
they temperaturerhöhung that for outcasts , co2 , which temperaturerhöhung and these summieren has some very negative effects on the weather and maybe even worse , the is a consequence that the natural ecosystems , such up with changes not to this and this whole systems , come together .
well , the exact number of connection between a temperaturveränderung and the net co2-anstieg and where the spawning more drastic consequences , there 's some of them , but not very many .
and there 's safe to be about , how bad consequences will . but they 'll be bad !
i have the top-wissenschaftler a asked , `` we need to really shut down on near zero to come from ?
does n't the half or a quarter ? ''
the answer is : until we 're near zero , is the temperature rise .
so it 's a big challenge .
it 's very different than to say , we have a fully three feet high office truck , the under a feet long , bridge to . the then you can basically , they ran out .
this must be very bottom , zero , .
well , we run into every year -- quite a lot of machine , 26 billion tons .
every american about 20 tons . people from the poor countries , less than one .
and the average are it about five million tons for every on the planet .
and somehow we need to change that are providing capabilities that this in a zero cost down .
it 's been consistently as up .
just different economic transformations is it 's shoulders and we need to of rapidem increase in go and to a reduction way to zero .
that equation has four factors . a little are . they have this thing left -- co2 -- that they 're moving towards zero to break and that will of the number of people depend , of the service that every man and the average , the average energy for every community services and the co2 , that per unit emittiert will .
you make us , which means of them individually and look carefully about this , we we did that to zero .
probably needs to one of these numbers very close to zero .
now that 's basic algebra , but we do about it through .
first , we have the population .
today life was 6.8 billion people ,
and it is progressing on foot 9 billion to . the factories , nine billion to move .
if we 're very successful with new vaccines , the reproduktionsmedizin and gesundheitsvorsorgung are we could be understood this to 10 percent to 15 percent mortality down , but , what we see a slope to 1.3 .
the second element of these are the services that we use .
that includes all , the food that we eat , clothing , tv , heating .
that are very good things and armutsverringerung mean , those services are almost every working on the planet accessible to .
it 's great life is that number drops .
in the rich world , in the top half billion , we could stain me make and less use , but the average will this number every year , and so in more than double , the number of services , the per person to be .
here we see a very basic services . there 's to home light , so you the homework can read it ?
and these students have n't it , so they go out and reading your of them under the straßenlicht .
well , in efficiency , the e , the energy per service , there 's got news .
we have something that 's not going up ,
because of success in häuserbau , each other autotypen , through new ways in lichtsektor , there 's a lot of services , their energy needed some of those services , is to 90 percent to reduce .
in other of service , like the manufacturing of lead back , is luftverkehr -- luftverkehr 00:05:58,000 or the > or 00:05:56,000 , is the window for improvement is very much .
overall , if we 're looking optimistically , we get maybe a reduction a factor in three or maybe even a factor in six .
but once in the first three factors , we are now of 26 billion , maybe allerbestes 13 billion tons gone . and that does not simply from scratch !
we look so the fourth factor , -- and this is a key to be -- that 's the amount of co2 , the per unit emittiert will .
it turns , the question , whether you that zero , get through .
if you 'll burn : no .
if you can burn : no .
almost every emittiert for electricity herstellungsmethode , co2 , except that renewables and time .
now , which we 're going on a global level to come up , is a new paradigm to create .
we need energiewunder .
now if i the term `` wonders '' means is , i mean not the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the pc is a miracle .
the internet and services is a miracle .
the people here have to the development of wonder contributed .
normally , there 's not know that you have a miracle to a particular , needs .
normally you basically just wrong and some people come to do n't .
in this case we need to but go there and a miracle in very short time .
now , i asked me , how can i that really rüberbringen ?
there 's a natural you , a demonstration , the the idea of people here with ?
i think back to the last year , when i mosquitos and somehow liked the people that .
the idea was for you really accessible , you know that it people that there with these life .
for energy i noticed that here .
i decided that the most of fireflies make my diesjähriger contribution to the would be here .
so here are a couple of natural or fireflies .
you has to me that they do n't bite . in fact , they will probably not the glass of traps .
well , there 's all kinds of spielereilösungen like this , but they bring all not much .
we need solutions , either one or any number of the an incredible scaling up and how incredible dependability . and although it many ways , there , where people do , we 're looking for zero , i really just five traits that these big needs to afford .
i have the tides , geothermal , fusion and they leave out .
these are going to maybe one i contributions and if you better afford when i expect to that would be great , but my 's here is that we all those five to work , and we ca n't of you give up , because it tells us this , because all have significant problems .
we look at first of the burning fossil fuels , burning of either way coal or gas .
what you want to get out , it may simply , but that 's not . you would have to all the co2 , that after the burning of the boat and comes to capture , under pressure verflüssigen and then , somewhere between them and hope that it there 's left .
there 's some well , having the time , 60 percent -- 80 percent are to create , but it on 100 percent to get is very difficult to be . and a way for the storage of the carbon that to make , is a big challenge . but the biggest problem here is the lagerzeitfrage .
it will make sure ?
who can guarantee , which literally a billion times bigger than any kind of garbage , the communication , of nuklear- and other things we can imagine ?
this is a lot of volume .
so that 's a tough place in .
the next thing : time .
the also has three big problems . the cost , especially in hochregulierten countries are high . the question after security , that you really feel that nothing wrong can walk , despite the human organization achieve that the fuel not for weapons that 's spent .
and what do you then with the garbage patch ?
because even though he does n't it 's very large , there 's lots of concerns .
so three very difficult problems that may be solvable , and gardening , where you why we 've had to work .
the last three of the five , i 've summarized .
it are those renewables , how they often be called .
and also the have -- although it 's great that they do n't make fuel you need -- they have some downsides .
one thing , is the energy that these technologies create dramatic lower than the of kraftwerken .
that are energiefarmen , you talk about of you think , 1,000 times more land area as a normal power .
and also see the vent sites we :
the it 's not all the day , it 's also not every day and similarly , but also the wind may not the time .
so you have to , if you of these various sources that 's dependent on , a way , the energy , in times when they 're not available , is to get .
there 's so large preisherausforderungen . there are challenges in the transmission . if we , say that the energy source outside the country , you do n't just the technology , you must also with the risk around that the energy from where different from .
and there 's the lagerungsproblem .
and the one dimension to show , i went on all kinds of the batteries , the be made , at , the work for cars , computers , phones , taschenlampen , for everything . and that i did with the amount of the electronic energy , which the world , compared . i found out that all the batteries , the now we produce , less than 10 minutes of energy systems might .
we need so here 's a big , something that to a factor in 100 times better future will be , when the approaches to the time .
that 's not impossible , but it 's not that .
that happens , you 're trying to these unterbrochenen sources of say we 20 percent -- 30 percent of the is to put it .
if you , is to 100 percent of it just want , they need an incredible things .
well , where we to go : what 's the right approach ?
a `` manhattan project '' ? how we get into the goal ?
what we need are many companies , the work at it . hundreds .
in every one of five areas we need at least 100 people .
in many , they will say , the are crazy ! it 's good .
i think , here in the ted group there 's a lot of the workforce , there 's been engaged .
bill has several different companies , one of a called solarthermaltechnologien the great esolar .
khosla vinod invested in dozens of companies the great things do and interesting ways to have and i 'm trying to support .
it was nathan and i pay for a company , the , may surprise , the nuclear force approach to follow .
there 's some innovations in nuklearbereich ; and modular , from liquid .
the development has in this industry some time ago stopped , so it 's no big surprise that some good ideas around .
that u238 means that you instead of a part of the end , of one percent , that u235 , we decided to the 99 percent and burn , that terrapower-konzept .
this is quite a crazy idea .
but actually had you about it already too long time thinking , but you could never as you can run , whether it would work , but since it modern world there , you 're modeling and see that : aye . with the right funktioniere , it looks like this from that it materialienherangehensweise .
and because that you 're 99 percent of burning , is that kostenprofil very much better .
actually burning to make the garbage , and you can even the waste of today about as antriebsstoff use .
instead , about the head to break , they burn it easy . one thing .
this is highly enriched uranium dioxide is so it , a little bit like a candle .
you see that 's a kind of that is , often than `` like this reactor '' by the .
that solve really that treibstoffproblem .
here 's a picture of a place in kentucky .
this is the waste , the 99 percent . you has the of this that today that you 're going , aufgebrauchtes so it says herausgenommen uranium .
that get the u.s. embassy for hundreds of years .
and if you filtriert inexpensive and just ozeanwasser , you get enough of fuel for the rest of lifetime of the planet .
you know , there 's still many challenges , but it 's a example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to move forward to come .
well think we , how we our success .
how should our testament to look ?
well , we go until the goal , that we get to and then we 're talking about the zwischenschritt .
many speak of giving 80 percent reduction until 2050 .
it 's really important , that we are going to universal .
the rest of 20 percent to be in poor countries be produced , and lifestyle , something that agriculture . hopefully will waldrohdung and cement , until then clean .
so , to make these 80 percent , to try to the developed , including those countries like china , their elektrizitätsgeneration completely change .
the other note she says , whether we the oil spill-cleaning technology , whether you in all the developed countries used is and we 're going on the way are , you to the rest to get .
that 's great important .
this is a shift : this zeugnisses .
if we from there go back , how should that by testimony to look ?
it should be back the two elements of them .
we should the co2-summe , use to reduce the on the way to put it . the less we emittieren it , the discover is the effektivitätsmaßnahmen be and we can also the temperature .
but actually is this note to the things that we are companies that do n't completely to the big reduktionen , just the same , or even something less important as the other , which the rapidity of innovation for this amazing breakthroughs that .
these are we need to go to track and that we can measure , in regulierungsänderungen , in pilotprojekten and firmenzahlen .
there 's many books to this topic .
that al gore book `` we have the choice '' and david without `` sustainable is mckays the hot air . ''
they go it really through and create a contemplative frame , for this wide , can be , because we need for support of all sides .
there 's a few things that come together to .
this is a wish .
a very specific wish that we do this technology .
if you me just a wish for the next 50 years from now , i could the president to pick them , lasts , and that i love , or i could this desire to choose , the question is , energiepreis halbierter without losing co2 is being invented . this desire whereas if i .
this has the biggest impact .
if we this desire does n't get there to the dig in between the long and that is think people will , between the u.s. and china , between the poor and rich countries . and almost all life of these two billion are very much worse .
what we need to do ?
for what kind of appelliere i ?
we need to for more research increases in the minds .
if countries in places like koppenhagen meet , they should not only about carbon to talk .
they should those innovationsstrategie go and they were shocked of the ridiculous , low funds , the for those who approaches to spend on board .
we need preissignal , carbon taxes , cap the trade something that a marktanreize creates .
we need to spread the message .
we need to it was and can lead and also the things that from the government be done .
it is a wish , but i think , we can see him meet .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thanks !
thank you . just about the terrapower something better to understand -- essentially first , you can make us an idea of the scale that investment , there ?
bill gates : the simulation is on a supercomputer to , all great scientist to get , what we 've done , we need just some 10 million . and even if we our materials in a russian nuclear reactor we have to make sure that 's about works , is you only in the 100en million .
the meeting and step is that build on the first time , another billion to find that regularien and the place on the fact , the first of it builds .
once the first is finished , if it that 's as i promised , then everything is very clearly , because the sense , the that 's so different than in time , how we know it .
the right to understand : that means in the ground to build , almost like a vertical . nuclear brennstoffs , this up , and then the process up and working on up to the bottom ?
bg : exactly . today , they have to the reactor 's always be new stuff , so there 's many people and lots of control is that go wrong can . this thing where you pressed it opens and stuff come in or this . that 's not good !
but if you very cheap fuel , the fudge factor for 60 years into your -- you think , an essential pillar -- that they bury them , without all the complexities .
and it 's sitting there and while for 60 years and then it 's finished .
a nuclear reactor , the myself a solution for the garbage is .
bg : yeah . now , what do with the garbage happens : you can sit -- there 's much less food waste , with this method -- then take it and grab him in the next reactor and burn it on .
and we start by saying , we the garbage can take answers , already exists , the in these startbrennstoff or trockenbehältern once in the reactors . this is our kühlbecken .
so is that , what these reactors run a problem was that , what we in our fill and so that will müllvolumen dramatically reduce during this process .
but while you with different people , this world over the opportunities 've talked ,
where is the main interest , so what really to implement ?
bg : well we 've still not on a place a zoning and there 's a lot more interesting energieagenda for everything that `` nuclear '' in the name is . there are big interest and the people the company in russia , india , china -- i was here and have the minister went and and talking about it , how this is to offenlegungsregeln does .
i 'm optimistic . you know , the french and japanese who have something in the direction .
this is a nuance of thing that was taken .
this is a crucial step forward , but it 's like a faster reactor and some countries have these are built , why is everybody , the a rapid reactor implemented , has a kandidatat for our first .
in their idea : over and likely to that really launched in to shout out ?
bg : well we need one of stromgenerierenden , skalierbaren things that 're very affordable , we have 20 years , for reinventing and then 20 years to use .
that 's sort of the deadline , giving us the umweltmodelle demonstrated that we 've got to .
and , you know , terrapower , if everything well , and that 's a wish , that might have easily .
and fortunately , there 's today , dozens of companies , and we need hundreds , the , as well , when their policies of work , the federal funding for your drone pilots works , for mitbieten can .
and it would be the most importantly , if it 's several create , because then you could a mixture .
anyway , we need a solution .
what , of the kinds of major breakthroughs , is this the biggest rule that you know ?
bg : a energiedurchbruch is the most important .
that it would also without the umweltherausforderung been , but the power it 's still so much more .
in the nuclear sector , there 's another very innovative companies .
you know , we know the work not as well , like this , but there 's the own way , that 's a different approach .
there 's a fluid reaktortyp , which is something hard seems , but you might say the foundations of us .
and so there 's different , but the beauty in it is that a kohlemolekül a million times as much energy has a , i , we say , a uranmolekül and so , if you with the problems can get around and the are mainly the radiation , the footprint and the cost , plays the potential , so the impact on the country and other things , almost in a own league table .
if that does n't , then what ?
we need to notfallmaßnahmen that come together to try that 's robust to hold ?
bg : if you in this situation , it 's as if you to a lot has eaten , and , just a heart . what do you then ? you need maybe one 's or anything .
there 's a zusammenzuraufen the geoengineering called the workforce , with various techniques is trying to get the warming continues to delay , so we 20 or 30 years longer had to us forschungsrichtung .
that 's just a versicherungsmethode .
you for is , that we had n't need .
some people say , you should n't just at the insurance to work , because one that might be lazy , so you eat , because you know that one that 's save will .
i do n't know if that 's smart is , if you , the importance of this problem of eyes , but now there 's a larger discourse in geoengineering about , whether you that 's available to have to , if the things faster or whatever , or this innovation longer need , when we expect .
climate change : you have a or two sentences for the way to you might want to convince them ?
bg : well , unfortunately , life , the skeptics in very different the .
who , the scientific 're doing , are very little .
they say that it 's negative effects that there with the clouds to do have , the things down here ?
there 's very , very few things that you even able to ask of which it 's a chance in a million there .
this up here 's like those with aids .
you make the mistake now , and you pay for this very much later .
and so this is the idea , now , if you all kinds of compelling problems has , in something to invest in that you 've only later , what 's -- and there 's that the investment not that 's clear . actually is the ipcc report did n't necessarily the worst case scenario and there 's people in the rich world , the ipcc look , and say , okay , that 's no big drama .
the fact is that this uncertainty of us going to do .
but my dream here is that , if you put it is can do , and at the co2 was eliminated , then also say the skeptics , `` okay , it . i 'm not saying that 's no carbon emittiert , i wish that it that if , but i 'm going to it has to accept , because it 's cheaper than the way this method . ''
and that would your answer on the armutsverringerung with the argument that , if you all this time and energy use to the co2 problem to solve , all the other goals suffer from it , the björn that 's of malaria and so that it 's a stupid waste of resources , is money for it to invest , while it 's a cleverer things that there is we can do .
bg : well , the actual spending for the research -- we say the u.s. government should be 10 billion per year more spend when they do today -- that 's not so dramatically .
it should be other things not suffer .
you then it comes to big geldsummen , and here we can make reasonable people with , if you something has , that does n't have economic is , and tried , that to finance . for me is going on the most of waste .
it 's because , you is very , just a kostendurchbruch and financed , to the learning . i think we should be more things are trying to the the potential have , very much cheaper to life .
if the energiepreis the , you get , a very high abstrich is , then can only the rich up .
i mean , each of us here could , five times as much for our energy on without his lifestyle to change .
for the bottom two billion but it 's a disaster .
and even with your way to .
his new masche is now , `` why is the research , is not talking about ? ''
he will always thinking , because of its former stories , with the forschungsargument associated , but it has understood that this one , which -- whichever group is and so it 's now that skeptiker-camp .
and that 's a of the , i for them appropriately , all right .
the research , it 's just nuts , how little the support system will .
bill , i think i speak for almost all people here , if i say , i really hope that their desire , were going . you very , thanks .
bg : thanks .
some years ago , here at ted , peter marshmallow-herausforderung a design-wettbewerb called `` the skillman '' ago .
the idea is pretty simple . vierer-teams to the biggest possible garden structure with 20 like , about . tall with tape , about . about ourselves and a marshmallow ; building .
the marshmallow to on top .
and , although it really just seems , it 's actually really hard , because it 's people who is very quickly work together .
and so i thought that this is an interesting idea is and i 've got it in a design-workshop into .
it was a huge success .
i 've been about 70 this world 's done , with students , developers and architects , even with fortune-50-unternehmen the ctos and there 's something , at this task , what some insights in the nature work with the technologies and i want to some of them to share with you .
normally go on the most of time , people in the task to orient .
you talk about , they go to look like it will look , they wrestle in order to power ,
then invest you a little time in planning and organization . they 're drawing out and eating out .
they invest a lot of their time in the molecular assembly the time into structures
and finally , just before they have no time have more money , take someone the marshmallow and they put him gently down on the top , we step back a and `` ta-da '' admire them their work .
what but then , almost always , happens is that the `` einstürzt '' to a `` uh-oh '' is , because the weight ; it worked out that the whole thing , we and ta-da .
there 's a series of people that much more `` bwl-absolventen '' -momente have to other , and under the worst are totally fresh uh-oh .
they 're lying , they cheat , they are confused and make really dürftige shapes .
and of course there 's also on the much more `` -gebilde '' ta-da have and under the aid are totally fresh alumni of this .
and that 's pretty amazing .
like us , peter told you 're not just the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
what you might ask will is : how is that ? why ? what about where ?
and peter told , `` none of the kids spend on time in it 's head of eating gmbh to be . ''
they invest no time in machtkämpfe .
but there 's still one another reason .
and that is that a trained , the one right plan to find , ok !
and then to realize .
then what happens , if you the marshmallow were on the top of this into , they have no time more and what happened ?
it 's a crisis .
sound familiar , what ?
what they do differently , is that they do with the marshmallow and prototypes to build , our prototypes , always with the marshmallow , had the top , so that you can the opportunity to have had prototypes to fix .
certainly see this kind of the collaboration as a nucleus of iterativen it .
and with every attempt to get the children 's what we heard what works and what do n't .
this is the performance , using prototypes to work , you much -- but we see once , how other teams to operate .
the average for the most at about . 50cm , a half of that , stodgy lawyers or something more , but not much , kindergarten kids are better than the adults .
who is at the most successful ?
architects and engineers , thankfully .
about is the ultimate , what i 've seen .
and why ? because they are triangles began to understand and sich-selbst-verstärkende geometric patterns are the key to really exquisite structures to build .
ceos are something about the average . but that 's , it 's interesting .
you a we take on the team , you going to dramatically better .
it 's unbelievable . you see , is to and see `` this team will win . ''
they can predict . why it work ?
because they 're holding on the attributes prozessbegleitung have .
they run the process , they understand him .
and the team that that and on the pursuit of paying attention is the performance of the training teams to dramatically improve .
where the skills and prozessfähigkeiten and the combination lead to success .
if you 10 teams have , the typical 're going to get you ca n't know , six , the really exquisite structures .
i tried something very fascinating .
i thought , we bring the pokereinsatz same .
so what i got a $ prize wish , software for the winner .
what you think happened with these design-studenten ?
what was the outcome ?
this happened . not a team had a stable structure .
if someone 's a 2,5cm of construction built have , he have the price home , by ice .
so it 's not interesting that high wetteinsätze a strong effect of ?
we repeated this exercise with the students .
what you think happened now ?
well understood it the advantage of the `` prototyping . ''
so from the , or for team of the best .
they produced the highest construction in the least of time .
there 's crucially , tief-greifende lessons for us , of the nature of incentive and success .
you might ask : why would somebody actually time to invest a marshmallow-challenge to create ?
the reason is , i 'll help digital tools and processes to make them to figure out teams to help , cars , video games and `` effects visual '' to make it .
and what the marshmallow-challenge does is , it helps them to make assumptions to identify .
because , frankly , each project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge is a shared experience , a common language , or sterility . ethos , the right -- to build .
and this is the value of that experience , this so easy to practice .
and those of you , the it 's interested , can marshmallowchallenge.com visit .
it 's a blog , where you see how to the marshmallow .
there 's a schritt-für-schritt-anleitung there .
they find examples from all the world , how people the system , we have and raffinieren .
there 's also weltrekorde .
and the verbindender lesson , i believe is , the structure actually a basale sports is .
it demands that we all our senses on the task to shoulder and that we think can optimally use , like our feelings and our do , in the challenge , the brink of us .
and sometimes it 's a small prototype this experience anything , what it needs to us from a `` ta-da '' -- to a `` uh-oh '' moment to put it .
and that can a big difference do .
thank you .
we do so when we would have here a machine ,
a big machine , a cool , ted-artige machine , and that 's a time .
and everybody in this room has to skeletal muscle .
and they can in the past go , they can in the future go ; they can not in here and now ,
and i wonder , what they would choose , because i my friends in a lot lately asked this question , and they wanted everybody in the past go .
i do n't know . they were interested in the time back , before it cars , there or twitter or `` america 's looking for the american idol '' .
i do n't know .
i am convinced that you kind of nostalgia , to thinking that is .
and that i can understand .
i 'm not part of the group , i must say .
i do n't want in the past , and that 's not , because i a explorers --
it is is that a few options on this planet does n't go back , they go forward .
so i want in this machine , and i want in the future go .
this is the greatest time to be it ever attempted on this planet there , whatever , the scale them on : health , wealth , mobility , opportunities , declining krankheitsraten .
it had never before a time , like this .
my ur-großeltern died of all when they were 60 were .
my grandparents were that number on 70 .
my parents are the 80 on the into iraq .
there should so eloquently than a nine the beginning of my todeszahl .
but it 's not time to people like us , because this is a lot more thing than that .
a kid , the today in new delhi born will can expect , so long to live as the richest man the world , 100 years ago .
you think this question . that 's an amazing fact .
and why is that ?
the smallpox . the smallpox have billion people on this planet killed .
they have the demographics of the earth in a way shaped , how it 's no war ever managed by .
they 're way . they have vanished .
we have you bezwungen . go pfft .
in the rich world are diseases , the millions of us only one generation still under threat , to have n't wait .
röteln , diphterie , see ...
don’t even though , somebody , what it is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability , billion people to feed , that are the scientific method .
and my view , is the scientific method , to test things , to see if it works , it change , if it does n't do , one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
so that 's the good news .
unfortunately , this is already all the good news , because there 's a few other problems , and they were often mentioned ,
and one of this is that despite all of our greatest achievements a billion people in the world every day 're going to sleep .
this number drops , and they are rising very quickly , and that 's a .
and not only that , we have our imagination to get used , this world that we had to is .
drinking water , heraus-innovieren country , rainforests , oil , gas , they disappear , which is pretty soon , and if we might not from this chaos urbares we also .
the question is so , we can do that ? i think it .
i think it 's clear that we food can produce , the billion people feed them will , without the country , they live , to rape .
i think , we can take this world with energy 's a way that they do n't both being destroyed .
i believe that really , and no , this is not thinking .
but this is looking at night about -- one of the things that me at night awake . we have the science progress are still never been so desperately to look like now , still never ,
and we were also still never happened in the opportunity to him in einzusetzten , like we it today can .
we are the verge , to an amazing , astonishing design events on many areas . and yet , i think really , that we are hundreds , 300 years ago , the enlightenment , go back to be able to a time to hunt in the we progress is doing , we about these things for getritten have to refuse any more about as now .
the people around in their believe , which is so closely , so that you do n't be free .
not the truth will they free .
and hear them , everybody has a right on his belief that ; even a right on his opinion , for progress ,
but you know , what they were no right ?
they have no right on their own facts . 'tschuldigung , you have n't .
and i have a while it , and then finally figure out .
ago , about a decade , i was a piece of vaccination , for `` the new yorker , '' written , a little paper .
and i was amazed , on the resistance to run into , on the resistance to the world , what the end of the most effective activity in health in the history of humanity 's .
i did n't know , what i should do , so i did just what i 'm doing , i wrote a paper and went on .
and soon i wrote a paper about genetically changed the food .
the same thing , only bigger .
the people who played crazy .
so i also about one articles written , and i could n't understand why , the people thought , that would `` übergriff , '' why they thought that , molecules on a particular kind of a random jumble of your a frankenfood on the area of nature .
but you know , i 'm doing what i do . i wrote the article , i did on .
i mean , i 'm a journalist ,
we have to type , we can take a , we go food , that 's okay .
but these articles were made me worried , and i could n't figure out , why , and finally , i found it turns out .
and that 's because it that these fanatiker , the me nuts were not look at no fanatiker were .
that were do people , educated people , decent people .
they were just as the people in this room .
and that got me like this is ...
but then i thought , you know what , we 're honest ,
we 're in one point where somewhere , we 're not just the same relationship to the progress as i used .
we 're talking zwiespältig of them .
we 're talking ironic , with little quotes says that , `` progress . ''
okay , for that there 's reasons , and i think we know , which is a reason that are .
we have this faith in institutions , but an authority , and sometimes in the science , those who lost , and there 's no reason why that 's not that should be .
you can just a couple of names and the people to understand .
chernobyl , us-präsidentschaftswahl , the challenger , vioxx , mass destruction , the bhopal 2000 .
i mean , you know , they can make their own list .
there 's ask and problems with the guys , which we thought that , they always like being right . be so they are skeptical .
imagine if you ask , they evidence , you some evidence .
they take nothing as empowered .
but now here 's : if you have evidence to get you have to this evidence , and that we 're not good .
and i can that out of the reason to say , we now in an epidemic of the fear for life , as i think they still never seen and that i hope will never see again will .
ago about 12 years was a story posted , a story that the röteln with the measles , mumps , and autismus-epidemie lasts and in connection .
very scary .
of studies conducted to see if that was true .
of studies should be conducted ; that 's a serious business .
the data came in .
the data came in from the united states , from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all the same , no significant correlation , no link , who does n't .
it makes no difference . it makes no difference , because we now believe , we believe , what we see , what we 're going to see to believe what does that we really feel .
we believe , did not a bunch of documents from one regierungsangstellten , the us data , there , and i understand that , i think that do we all .
but you know what ?
the result of it was devastating ,
what because of fact : the u.s. is one of the only countries in the world , in which the immunization rate for them down .
this is and scandalous that we should be ashamed .
it 's terrible .
what happened that we do that could .
well , i understand that . that i 'm doing .
because here who do ?
has a single vine in the audience ever meet somebody will die see ?
it 's not very often .
happening in this country do n't actually , but in the world , the last year .
that are many deaths made by measles , 20 per hour .
but because that 's not happening here is , we can it out , and people like to mccarthy can run around and writing messages of anxiety and illiteracy , platforms like watching oprah and larry king live preach it .
and that you can do , because they cause and correlation not connecting .
they do n't understand that these things seem to be , but almost never the same thing .
and that 's something that we need to learn , which is very quickly .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk institute .
he has liberated us from one of the worst of hostages of humanity .
not afraid , no distress , polio , go pfft , disappeared .
the guy in the middle not so good .
he is paul offit .
he has just with a few other people a rotavirus-impfstoff evolved .
it can get the lives of 400- , a million children per year in the developing save .
pretty good , not ?
well , that 's good , besides that that paul walking around and over -- talks and says , how valuable they are , and that people were simply stop thinking about going to stay complaining .
and that says he actually so .
paul 's so a terrorist .
if paul in a public at talks , he can not without being armed guards at these statements .
he calls home , because the people with him to tell that you know where his children to school .
and why ? because , a vaccine against has done .
i do n't need this say , but vaccines are essential .
you take them , to the disease go back , terrible disease , and this is happening .
we have in this country now do .
and that will get worse , and pretty soon be kids back to die , because that 's just a question of numbers .
and they 're not only will die .
what about see ? we take that . why not ?
a kommilitonin of me has to me a few weeks ' written and said they think i 'm a little to loud .
nobody has ever said before .
they would their kid 's not against polio , like . , no , .
subtle .
why ? because we do n't see this , and you know what ?
we had in this country who was n't see .
today , i do n't know , maybe as in this morning , somebody in lagos , a plane and going to los angeles , the moment he 's about ohio .
and in a few hours it lands and ted-dinner a car , and he comes to long beach , and he is one of fantastichen mietet tonight is to visit .
and he does n't know that he with one of debilitating illness are infected is , and we know that 's also not , because that works the world .
this is the planet , we live . they do n't so , as if he did n't that is .
we love it , us in lie to itself . we love that .
they have this morning , all their had taken ?
antioxidantium , a little echinacea , that you on the thing you can help .
i know , that they 've done , because half the americans that every day .
they take this stuff , and they take an alternative is , and it makes no difference , how often we find out that they 're useless .
the data , the time .
they darkness as their urine . do more they almost never .
that 's okay , they want to be in 28 billion dollars for the dark , numbers .
i 'm with them to .
it urine . dark .
why we doing this ? why we doing this ?
well , i think , i understand -- we hate the pharma industry .
we hate a strong government . we have n't trust the solar system .
and that we should also not . our healthcare system is a learning .
it 's cruel to millions of people .
it 's absolutely amazing cold and seelentötend ourselves to us , the , it can afford .
we walk and so before that way , and where we ?
we walk in the poor the placebo-industrie .
that 's great . i love the placebo-industrie .
but you know , that 's really a serious business , because this stuff is crap , and we give billion dollars for me .
and i 've all kinds of little slice through here .
none of -- acai , was , echinacea , was , gingko , because i know not present , what this is , but we give billion dollars for it looks like , it is , .
and you know what ? if i 'm saying , shouting at me the people , and say , `` what does it ? let the people do , what they want .
so , it feels good . ''
and you know what ? they 're wrong .
it because i did n't is , whether it the minister is , who says , `` hmm , i 'm going to the earliest evidence of experts to mammography does n't suppose '' or any kaffe-einläufen , the his patients with krebs-quacksalber treat want .
if you stand on this way to , where do believe and magic of the and science to replace , get them to a place , they do n't want to be .
they get to i mean in south africa .
he brought the expense of people , because he insisted that red zitronenöl , knoblauch and beete much more than any antiretroviral drugs are tales , which we know that you , the course of aids or can .
hundreds of these deaths in a country , the worse than any other of this illness who will .
you tell me , please do n't that these things are no grave implications for .
the have you . that they 've always .
well , the bio-elite epidemic was doing , we are at is that this to fight between the befürwortern genetically modified foods and the hirnloseste .
that 's a idiotische debate . they have to stop .
it 's a debate about words , about metaphors .
that 's anti-israeli ideology , not science .
everything , what we eat , every petersilie , each branch reiskorn , anybody talking , was the people changed .
you know , there 's no mandarinen in the garden .
there 's no cantaloupe-melonen .
there 's no christmas tree . we have this all done .
we have it in the last thousand years .
and some of this has been working and it 's not .
we 're kind of , what does n't work .
now we can it 's do . and course there 's risks . but we can do something like vitamin a in rice do , and that stuff can million people , helping million people , their life to extend .
that you want to do n't do ?
i have to say , that i do n't .
we refuse so , food .
why we do that ?
well , what i always worried about this is : to a lot of chemicals , pesticides , hormones , monokultur , we want not a huge areas with a thing , that 's wrong .
we want to do n't realize that companies who live and patent .
we want to do n't realize that companies seeds have .
and you know , what my answer on all this is ?
yes , they are right . how we that .
it is , we have a huge nahrungsproblem , but that 's not science .
that has with science nothing to do .
it 's really , i morality , patentkram .
you know that the science is not a company is .
it 's no country .
it 's not an idea ; it 's a process .
it 's a process , and sometimes work he and sometimes not , but the idea that we do science , not allow you to her work to do , because we fear is really a dead end , and it 's making millions of people flourishing taking off .
you know , in the next 50 years we going to 70 percent more than growing food to disclose than the moment . 70 percent .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
i . that .
they need that , and we give it does n't give you .
and why ? so , food .
we want people do n't be empowered , this maniok stuff to eat , like for example verrottete .
maniok is something that half a billion people eat .
it 's about how a potato .
it 's just a bunch of calories . it 's a learning .
it has not require nutrients , it has not a protein , and scientists building that all right now at a .
and then you might the people the food and would n't be blind be .
they would n't starving , and you know what ?
that would you . it would n't panisse chez , but it would you .
and everything , what i want to tell you can do is : why are we that ?
i mean , we ask : why are we that ?
because we 're not genes herumschieben want ?
it 's not about , genetics around . it 's not to throw chemicals .
it 's not about our a passion for hormones , our it on your food , better food , that food .
it 's not about the white rice krispies , it 's about , people at the life to get up , and it is the time , to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we do n't do this , if we so on how far do , we undertake a little bit guilty , we , i believe , not guilty want to be , high-tech colonialism .
there 's no other description for that , what happened here .
it 's acting selfish , it 's ugly , it 's our not worthy , and we need to the really stop .
after this incredibly kind of entertainment want to say , they might say , `` you want , still in this ridiculous time machine and in the future go ? ''
anyway , . that i want , so this .
the moment is inside them in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can take this time machine on all imagine , what we want .
we can you 're , where we they 're trying to , and we 're going to you get there are moving , where we want .
we need to these conversations , and we need to think , but if we in the time machine , and in the future go we will be happy to be , that did have them .
i know that we do it can , and as far it as i 'm like this is something that the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
for quite some time i 've come for the placebo-effekt . it strange you might seem that , a magician interested in that , it 's because , you look at it as i am , as `` a deception that to something that will , if someone just enough that anybody believes . ''
with other words , placebo-effekt have in some studies conducted a measurable effect , showed the schmerzmanagement , which is just so , because the person thinks , what happens to be a pharmaceutical or a kind of the placebo-effekt , for instance , there 's , if the patient 's just enough that anybody thinks , a measurable effect in the body that you make the zuckerpillen calls .
a deception is going to something that , because somebody 's so much time .
so that we 're also understanding , i want to you now a fundamental , very simple trick to show .
and i 'll show you , he works . that 's a trick , the least for the 1950s , any zauberbuch for children .
i 've made him from the cub and the classroom in the 1970s learned .
i 'm going to him for you do to and then explain .
and then i 'll explain why , i 'll explain .
so , you see , what happens .
the knife , that they 're looking at can ; my hand , the they 're looking at handling .
i 'm going to the knife just so in my hand .
i 'm my sleeve back .
and to be sure that nothing in my sleeve disappears , or from him out , i 'll just my wrist on right here zusammendrücken .
this way , you can see that , to none of time you move . as i here zudrücke , nothing can not in my sleeve up to or turn out .
and the goal is very simple .
i 'm going to my hand up , and hopefully , if everything goes well , is the knife by my bare physical and that .
it 's actually so strong believers , its place that i it can , without realizing that knife went off .
nothing goes in my sleeve , or it comes out , no trickserei . and they can all a very much .
ta-da !
well , this is a trick , who i realized a little kids out the workforce , for magic interested , because you can be very much about deception to learn , if you delve deeper look closely , although it 's a very simple auszuführender trick is .
probably know many of them in this room watching this trick .
he works is :
i think at the knife in my hand .
i 'm saying that i my wrist umschließe , to make sure that nothing in my sleeve disappears , or out , and that 's a lie .
the reason why , i my wrist festhalte , is the , in that , underlying the secret of illusion is made .
in the moment is , where i mean by hand of you wegdrehe , so you them back of see , moves , this one finger and here , my foundation , just from there , where he was , in a position , when he 's so that is .
really wonderful trick ?
back there 's sitting , someone who do this childhood had .
so , he , this is here . right .
and if i think umdrehe , changing the hands on its position .
and now you could talk about why that a deception is , you why not perceive that down here 's just three fingers to see are : because the mind and the way , he , have collated crowd-sourced data , they 're not one by counting , one , two , three , but it into a group can see .
but it 's about now here 's not actually . and then we i mean by hand .
course it will there would have no , but not by the and my body , but through a trick , through my foundation , the now there is .
and when i mean by hand , let me , what happens to the same thing , by i zurückbewegt , going through this movement be that the finger , again zurückdrehe .
i assume that hand away . and this is the knife .
this trick , they can your friends and to demonstrate . thanks .
well , what has this with the placebo-effekt to do ?
a year ago or so , i read a study that i 'm really right away from .
i 'm not a doctor or scientists , and so i was that for me an amazing thing .
it has , because what turned out : if you a on in form of a white pill to offer , in the form of a aspirintablette , is that just a round , the pill , the one of measurable effect .
but if you the shape , when you that can give an example , in a smaller pill to change , and these blue color and a letter after that now , it is actually see more effectively .
and that even though , no matter of any so ... it are just zuckerpillen .
but a white ball is not as well as a blue pill .
what ? that made me really weird freak .
it turned out , but out that that still not it 's .
if you 're making it , the people are still more effective than there every form .
a colored capsule , the end of yellow and across the red is that 's better than a white capsule .
also the dosierung plays a role .
a pill twice a day is not as well as three -- and i ca n't going to the exact , remember . you know i 'm sorry .
the really important but this is to ...
that 's also the matter , play a role .
and the shape plays a role .
and if you the ultimate placebo-effekt 've got to say , you have to the needle in your grasp .
right ? a syringe with a wirkungslosen -- a few milliliter a wirkungslosen substance that you make a patient gets into .
that creates a very strong brand image in mind . that 's very much stronger than a white pill .
this chart is really -- i 'm they do you a another time to show , if we have a table .
fact , so this is that the white or so not as well it looks like the blue pill , the not as well it looks like a cramped capsule that do n't so well it looks like the needle .
and it has some really quite amazing property . it 's only our believe it , going to us a greater impact on .
i wanted to know that i do this idea for a magic trick could use .
i 'll do something that obviously a deception is , and making it really quick look .
we know from the study that you go to the needle is to be , if it on the thing is about .
this is an inch long hutnadel . it 's very , which . and i 'm going to you first one little bit this .
this is really my meat . it 's not damians special like meat .
this is my skin . that is no effect of hollywood .
i 'm now this needle in my skin is and through them up , until you on the other side bounce back out .
if you it 's going -- if they easily in order collapsing fall -- i did that a few friends last night in the hotel room the , and some people that i do n't know , and this is a woman who almost like become .
i 'm so ago , if you very quickly this is , then you look for the next 30 seconds away . or , you know what , i 'm going to the first is part back here do .
it can see in a , they can but also wegsehen , if you want .
so , it 's so , right here , where my it starts , the bottom part of my arms i 'll just a little just do .
you know i really sorry . it does this crazy ?
and now just a little bit through my skin and on the other side that way back out .
now we 're actually in the same emerged that we do the messertrick had .
about .
but now you can my fingers do n't count , right ?
so , when i do you show you . that 's a , two , three , four , five .
well ,
i know , what the people think , if you see that .
they say , `` okay , who 's not so stupid and durchsticht , to show the skin , just to us a few minutes long to be entertained . ''
well , then i 'll show you .
look like this from ? well .
yes , i know .
and the people back to say , `` okay . i did that 's not seen . ''
the people in the nebenräumen come now in .
you make it me give them from the next to show .
this is really my skin . that is no effect of hollywood .
this is my meat , and i can that 's .
you know i 'm sorry . if you it 's going , you look away , you look , do n't .
the people back or one , the that later , eventually , sitting on see , to say , `` well , that looks fairly impressive , but if it really scare them is , he would be -- you see , here 's a hole and there , if it really think it would , it would we bleed . ''
okay , let me tell you a little bit of blood for you herausquetschen .
yes , it there .
normally would i now the needle and .
i would my arm safe and show you that there are no wounds .
but i think , in this frame here and with the intention , from a deception that 's going to do , i 'm the needle in there 's awareness and so from the stage go .
we 're going to us in the next days are still a couple of time to face .
i hope that you look forward , that . thank you .
everybody talks about today about happiness . .
i have some people the number of books count that deal with `` happiness '' in the title in the last five years , and they gave way , about 40 on , and there 's still much more .
there 's a massive wave of interest , you 're lucky , explorers .
there 's very much glücks-coaching .
everybody would like the people have been doing .
but despite all of flood of work , there 's several different cognitive systems that it , almost impossible make , clear about happiness thinking .
and my talk today is mainly from these cognitive faculties .
this is for in , the of their own happiness , you think and it is true for scientists , the of happiness is think that , because it turns out that we just like that mess that are like everyone else .
the first of this is a widerstreben , complexity by admitting this .
it turns out , that the word , just not a useful in the word is , because we do it on to all of how to work .
i think , there 's a particular meaning , on the we it you could , but in the great and all this is that something that we give up to be considered , and we 're going to the complicated perspective will have to see that , what well-being is .
the second case is one of experience and memory , in basically consists of them between be happy in his life and be happy about his life or happy with his life .
and that are two very different concepts , and they 're both zusammengeworfen in the idea of happiness .
and the third is the konzentrations-illusion , and this is the unfortunate fact that we 're not about a situation that can think , the well-being remember , without its importance to warp .
i mean , this is a cognitive trap .
there 's simply no way , it right length to get .
now i 'd like with an example start of someone who , a kreischendes had one of my lectures , the a story that . [ unclear ] he said , he had a symphony heard , and it was absolutely beautiful music , and the very end of the shot , there 's a fürchterliches frage-und-antwort-sitzung sound .
and then put it , really quite emotionally , that has the whole experience ever ruined .
but that had n't .
what it had were the memories , the experience .
he had the experience of out .
he had 20 minutes herrlicher music had .
they they do n't , because he with a memory verblieben was ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was all , what he goes to keep getting my life .
what makes us that actually says , is that we about us and about other people think might in terms of two types of myself .
there 's a erlebendes myself , that in the present lives and the presence today knows , is capable , the past back to experience , but , just the present .
it is the anfasse myself , that the doctor anpricht -- you know , when the doctor asks : `` does it hurts , if i want you here erlebende ? ''
and then there 's a erinnernde myself , and that erinnerndes itself is that , that it and the story of our lives in fact , left , and it 's what may , that the doctor who have been by he the question is , `` how do you have recently , that ? ''
or `` how was their journey , it ? '' or so similar .
this are two very different entities , that erinnernde ourselves and that erlebende myself , and the two to confuse this is part of the ensuing the different from happiness .
so , that erinnernde itself is a storyteller .
and that is really begin with a basic reaction to our memories -- it begins immediately .
we tell not just stories , if we do , stories to tell .
our memory tells us stories , that is , what we of our experiences for too must is a story .
and let them micht with an example start .
there 's an old one study .
that are real patient 's the workforce , a painful and into place .
i 'm not going into it go . you today is not more painful , but it was painful , when that study in the 1990s , and did was .
they were asked to all of 60 seconds about their pain to report .
and here are two patients . that are your records .
and they 're asking , `` who of these people has suffered ? ''
and that 's a very simple question .
patient , b has suffered . his darmspiegelung was no longer , and every minute of pain , the patient is a , had had a patient , b , and more .
but now there 's a different question : `` how very thought these patients that you , there ? ''
and here 's a surprise :
and the surprise is that person is a in a lot darmspiegelung erinnrung going to the schlechtere had as a patient , b .
the stories of darmspiegelungen were different , and because a very big part of the story is , how it ends up --
and no one of these stories is very erbaulich or great -- but one of them is this shows ...
but one of them is clearly became worse than the other .
and one , the worse is was the , where the pain the very end on its zenith , was . it 's a very bad history .
where we know that ?
because we these guys , after their darmspiegelung wondered , and having , too much later , `` how it was the whole thing in general ? `` well ,
and it was much worse for a , as to b in the erinnrung .
well , this is a direct conflict between the erinnernden ourselves and the erlebenden itself .
second , from the schlechtere even had to b clearly a erlebenden time .
well , what you with a patient , a , could do , and we 've actually is done experiments , and it 's been done , and it works , you could actually the darmspiegelung of patient is a to do , by just the hose in it makes no to very , give him to rolling .
this is going to lead to the patient is suffering , but only a little and much less than before .
and if you that a few minutes long makes you have consequences is that the erinnernde ourselves from person is a worse off is and you has already does that the erlebende ourselves from person is a lot up better is , because now , you get a patient , a in a better story about his experience has given .
and draws , a story from ?
and this is for the stories that the memory of us and it 's also for the stories that we invent .
and , a story , are these , great moments , and end .
and that are very , very important and in this case is the end .
so , that erlebende even live his life and continuously .
it has moments of erlebens , one after the other .
and they ask : what happens with these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they 're always been lost .
i mean , most of those moments of our lives -- and i did that it so -- you know , the psychological presence than about three seconds long . which means , you know that it in a life about 600 million of there . in a month there 's about 600,000 times . the most of you leave no lane .
the most of you will be completely ignored by the erinnernden itself .
and yet , they get a kind of the impression that they count that what during these moments of erlebens happens in our lives is .
it 's the limited resource that we use as we 're in the world are .
and how we they say they would seem to be important , but that 's not the story , having the erinnernde even for us that .
so we do this erlebende ourselves and that erinnernde myself , and they 're really quite different .
the biggest difference between them is the things that you with time .
second , from the einwöchige myself , if you a vacation and the second one week that is good as the first , it is the zweiwöchige vacation at twice as well as the erlebenden vacation .
so it work not for the erinnernde itself .
for the einwöchige itself is a zweiwöchiger 's hardly any more than the erinnernde on holiday , because there 's no new memory be added .
they have the story does n't changed .
and this way , is time actually on the variable that a erlebenden itself is different from one erinnerndes itself . time has very little impact on this story .
so , that erinnernde even more , as to remember , and stories to tell .
it 's actually what may , this is making decisions , because if you have a patient who have , the outcomes , we are two darmspiegelungen in two different kinds of surgeons had and decide , which he would choose to do , it 's the , the votes of the answers , the memory , the less bad thing is and that 's the surgeon , the winner selected will get .
that erlebende itself has no voice in this choice .
actually do we choose not between those experiences . we choose between those memories , experiences .
and even if we 're going to the future thinking , we think , our future n't usually as painful experiences .
we think about our future , as vorausgesehene memories .
but basically , can you look at , you know , as a tyranny of the erlebende myself , and they can , the erlebende even think more than one that kind of the erinnernde themselves getting through experience , having the erinnernden themselves do n't need .
i have the impression that if we 're going to travel this is a narrative is the case , that means that we do on vacation largely , in a little bottle of the erinnernden itself .
and that 's a little bit hard to justify , i think .
i mean , how very what we of our memories ?
this is one of explanations , for the dominance of the erinnernden itself is given .
and when i think about , i think , a holiday on the , we 're going on a few years in antarctica . 've done , who clearly the best vacation trip was the , i ever had his , and i think quite often in the ratio , how often , i do other day think .
and i 've probably from my memory , these gezehrt journey , i 'd say about 25 minutes long in the last four years dreiwöchige .
well , when i ever since the folder has opened up by interacting with the 600 images and i would have another one hour spent .
so , that are three weeks , and that are its peak half hours .
because it seems a get to give them .
well , i like a little be , you know , for , and how little appetite , i on the podium away from memory , but itself , if you more of doing there 's a real question . why we give memories so much weight in verlgeich to the weight , that we are there ?
so i want to that they do about a i think .
you imagine your next on vacation ago , you know that the end amnestisches all their pictures will and they get a urlaubs drug , so that , they 're not remind us to be .
well , would you the same thing started going to choose ?
and if you a different vacation would choose , there a conflict between her two types of ourselves and they have to think about , as you this conflict decide , and that 's really do not obvious , because if you in terms of time thinking they get an answer . and if you in terms of memories think they could make a different answer .
why we the hdtv , and choose that we choose which is a problem . east-northeast us with a choice in the two types of myself .
well , the two types of ourselves into two words on the good fortune on .
there 's actually two concepts of happiness that we can use , of myself .
so they can ask : how happy is that erlebende itself ?
and then they would ask : how happy are those moments in life of the erlebenden itself ?
and they 're all -- lucky enough for which is a pretty complicated process .
what are the emotions , the measured to evolve ?
and , the way , we 're now in a pretty good idea to get the worst luck of the erlebenden ourselves over the time .
if you after the luck of the erinnernden yourself questions , it 's a very different thing .
this is not about this , you how happy one person who lives .
it 's about this , you how happy or close up the person is , if this person about their lives , it .
very different .
everybody , the those terms n't really different is the exploration of the happiness up , and i belong to a lot of explorers of well-being , the ways of exploration of the so long screwed have on exactly that way .
the distinction between the luck of the erinnernden ourselves and the average happiness the erlebenden itself is in the last years had actually been , and now , tries to be , the two by death rate .
the gallup organization has to a global survey , and more than a half million people ask for himself had been are about that you about her life thinking and about their experiences . and there 's another efforts in the direction .
in the last years we 've started , about happiness . of these two types of ourselves to learn .
and the main one lesson that we , i believe , have learned is that they really different .
they can know , how happy somebody with his life is , and that teaches you really not a lot about , how happy when he would be living her life and vice versa .
just to make them a sense of the correlation to convey , the correlation is about .5 .
what this is that when you would meet and you would tell you , oh , his father 's a zwei-meter-mann , how much would you about its size of knowledge ?
well , they would do something about its size know , but there 's much uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
if i tell you that someone with his life than eight on a scale from 10 erlebenden has you have much uncertainty about , how happy when he 's with his eingeordnet itself .
the correlation is so low .
we know something about what that satisfaction from the glücks-selbst rules .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness is , is very pleased to be with people that we like , time to spend with people that we like .
there 's other occupational pleasure , but that 's dominant .
so if you the good luck of these two types of themselves do want you will be the end very different things to do .
the implication of the boat , what i 've said , is that we 're lucky really not imagine i 'd rather than a substitute for well-being .
it 's a completely another term .
well , very quickly , n't take a reason , which we 're not clear about happiness can think this is that we 're not on the same things to pay attention when we talk about the life thinking and if we actually life .
so if you the simple question , how happy the people in california are they will not the correct answer .
if you that question imagine if you think that the people in california be happier to if you , we say , in ohio gave life .
and what happens is that if you about the lives in california , you think you think , the difference between california and other places , and that difference is , we say , in climate .
well , it turns out , that climate is not very important for the erlebende itself is , and it 's not even very important for the thoughtful myself , that will decide , how happy people are .
but now , because the thoughtful itself is responsible , you can the end -- some people might the end , california .
and it 's kind of interesting to track , what happens with people know , the california in the hope , as bastardy .
now , you erlebendes themselves will not be happier .
we know that .
but one thing will happen . you think that you happier , because if you think about you 'll end of it will , like the weather in ohio . and they 'll feel that you , the right decision met .
it 's very difficult , clear about well-being of thinking , and i hope , i told them a sense of that , how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question to you .
thank you .
now , when we 're going on a few weeks on have they mentioned to me that it 's a pretty interesting result , there , that , from this gallup survey .
this is something , what they us so let can , because they now a few minutes left of ?
perhaps : sure .
i think that most exciting results , that we in the gallup survey found have is a number that we absolutely not to find we did .
we found that in terms of the good luck of the erlebenden itself .
if we were watching how , emotions with the income that .
and it turns out , that under a income of 60,000 dollars in the year , for americans , and that 's a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it 's a big representative sample , under a income of 600,000 dollars in the year
60,000 .
dk : one .
60,000 dollars in the year are the people unhappy , and they 're increasingly less happy , the more than they will .
it 's why we get a flat line .
i mean , i 've ever do so flat lines seen .
and what happens is obvious that money , no erlebnis-glück you , but that lack of money one certainly do you , and we can make this time , really clear to measure .
in the sense of the other self , the erinnernden myself , you get a different story .
the more money you earned the high levels is you .
this is not for emotion .
but danny , in the entire american and it 's going to live , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
when people who , that take seriously , i mean , where it 's on the head to imagine , everything , what we believe , for example , in terms of policy and so forth .
there 's a chance that politicians that the country is generally a complementary finding out how the take seriously consider to and that 's based on governance to make up ?
dk : you know , i believe that 's the there for the role of the glücksforschung in the policy .
the recognition is slow to be in the united states , no question , but the uk i happened if you just and in other countries have happened if you just .
the people are , recognizing that they 're lucky to think should , if you know , politics are thinking .
it will be a while , and the people will discuss them , whether they lebens-bewertung explore want or whether they erlebnis-glück exploring those cases , so we have this debate pretty soon .
how to happiness can go very differently depending upon it , as you think and if you know , that erlebende even think or whether you know , that erinnernde even thinking .
this is politics , i think , in the coming years .
in the united states erlebnis-glück you and behold , that strengt the population growth rate .
this is , i think , in the next a or two decades part of the national statistics actually .
well , it strikes me , this is subject , or should include at the most important political debate to pursue be about the next few years .
thank you for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , it did .
i 'm watching jane mcgonigal , i make games .
i think now been 10 years online games . and my goal for the next decade is , it as easy to make , the world in the reality to save , as you in online-spielen to save is .
i have a design for . i want to be more people to convince them , including you all , more time with the play more and tollerer games to spend .
now we spend three billion hours per week with online-spielen .
some of you might think , `` that 's a whole time for games . ''
maybe something to much time , when you think about how many problems we desperately in the real world to solve .
turns out , my research at the center for the future that , is the exact opposite accurately .
three billion hours per week are n't even close enough to get the most problems of the world to solve .
actually i am convinced that , if we have the next century on this planet survive want , we this time to dramatically increase to .
i 've calculated that the issue took time in 21 billion hours in a week .
that appears first maybe something abwegig , so again . i do it , so it ca : if we have issues like hungry , poverty , climate change , global conflict and obesity want to solve , i believe , we need to try to play online for one or 21 billion hours per week until the end of the next decade to play .
no , i mean it really seriously .
why ? this picture is quite right , why i believe that games are so critical for survival of the human species in the future are . seriously .
this is a portrait of the photographer toledano phil .
he wanted to the feelings of play , it . and so he ago , the players create a camera put up .
this is one of the classic affinity groups of play , .
if you do n't want gamers are , we think , you maybe some of them in this picture .
you 'll probably this sense of urgency , a little bit scared , but also very antithesis of concentration , one in that solve a really tough problem .
if they also play , you see some of them here , the top gezogenen eyes and the mouths are a sign of teenage optimism . the eyebrows present to take a surprise .
this is a player , the the edge of a so-called clash that epic , it 's right .
oh , you know the . ok. now . so we have some outstanding players here .
a epischer victory is a result , that looked very positive is that they would n't know that it was possible .
it was something beyond the imagination .
and if you reach , they 're shocked to keep them to actually something that are capable . that 's a epischer victory .
of these players , just a his victory .
and this is it , what we 're going on millions of faces of taking on the planetary scale , you need to , if we are the next century in an advantage to take . the face of those , the feeling a result in against the edge of his victory .
well , unfortunately , we see more like this face in real life , if we difficult problems with .
i call it as the `` in life i 'm pretty bad '' -gesicht . and it 's actually my face , you see ? yes ? ok .
that i am , as i think that `` in life i 'm pretty bad '' -gesicht do .
this is a graffiti -- in my former head home in berkeley , california , where i in my ph.d. studying why we in games are better than in real life .
this is a problem that many football players have .
we think that we in the reality is not so good are like in games .
and i mean not only less succeed , though that heard .
we reach in spielwelten more . i mean well in the connection with the motivation , something meaningful to do , inspired collaboration with each other .
if we 're in a spielwelt are , i believe that many of us , in our best version into , anytime and immediately to are , for the problem to solve , and trying so long as much needed , it after the failure to try .
and in the reality , if we fail , if we 're on the barriers , into space , feel we often different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel gone forever . we feel threatened , maybe depressed , frustrated -- or i .
these feelings , we 've never , if we play games , in games are there it does n't .
and this is it , what i as a to look at .
why is it in games impossible to think , you could n't simply reach it all ?
how we can these feelings of the play in the reality ?
so i looked at games like the world of warcraft , forgetting that the ideal environment to actually solving it .
and i have some things that , the epic journey here in online-welten as possible to do .
so , first time you in one of online and , especially in the world of warcraft , there 's a lot of characters that are willing , you a anzuvertrauen mission weltrettende , which is immediately .
but not just some mission , but a mission that fit perfectly to her current level of the game fits , right ?
so they can do that .
they 're getting ever get a task that you ca n't solve .
but always the edge of their skills , so they have to try better . but there 's no unemployment in world of warcraft .
you is not around and turns around . there 's always very specific and something important to do .
and there 's tons of staff .
where they also go , hundreds of people that deal with them together to evaluate their epic mission this .
that we have in real life not that simple , that feeling that in a fingerschnipsen of employees agreed to stand .
also , there 's this epic story , this inspiring story , why we 're there and what we have to do .
then we can get this whole positive feedback .
they have of `` level up '' and `` all , '' or heard `` all of intelligence . ''
this constant feedback , there 's not in real life .
if i want to the stage was leaving , i did n't , which is , here and all crazy idea , +20 crazy idea .
i get in real life that give feedback is not .
so , the problem of spielwelten how world of warcraft , is that it this sort is , anytime the edge of that epic , to stand out that we prefer to our whole time in these kooperations-online-welten spend .
they 're just better than the reality .
until today have all the world of azeroth 5,93 million years trying to , the virtual problems of warcraft-spieler to solve .
that 's not necessarily something bad .
it might sound bad .
but to make it in context to see , if primatenvorfahren million years , started our first 5,93 tries to go .
the first of a primate .
ok , so if we talk about it , how much time we currently working with play spend , does that just make sense when to the time in terms of scale of human eyes are holding what happens , which is .
but also be appropriate . because it turns out , that we by saying , we this whole time to play using , actually changing this , what we as people in the are able .
we develop us to collaborative skills , very much beings .
this is the truth . i think .
at once they these interesting about statistics , the recent graduating from a researcher at the carnegie mellon university was published , the average young man of today , in a country with strong online-spielen spend 10,000 hours with spielkultur to the 21st century . age .
so , 10,000 hours blood-flow is an extremely interesting number , from two reasons :
first time , for children in the united states are gesamtzeit hours of the exact 10.080 that they do in school , spend , of the fifth grade to spend in the high school -- if you never been missing .
so we have here a complete parallelbildungsweg , on the young people as easy to explore what it means , a good poker player to be , like anything other , which it in school , learn .
and may have any of the new book of malcolm gladwell , `` überflieger , '' read .
so you know about his theory of the success , the theory of the success of 10,000 hours .
it builds on the great research on the kognitivwissenschaft that , if we have 10,000 hours with the that was one of any subject to the 21st century . you spend , we will be able to anybody coming in it .
we are so good for , and you know , to do , how the most people the world .
now , which we have here , is a generation of young people , the meister-spieler are .
the big question is so , `` what exactly are player 's really good ? ''
because that if we find out of guinea , if we have of that had never been there gewesenes human potential available to .
so many people have we currently in the world , the least an hour a day with online-spielen spend .
this is our meister-spieler . 500 million people , the home -- well , `` something '' are .
and the next decade we have another one billion players , the home -- well in , whatever .
if you find it 's still do n't have heard ,
the right breitband-internet , the energy savings too , and on mobilfunknetzen work , instead of the konsolen , so players around the world , especially in india , china , brazil online to play .
you 're expecting an extra one player in the next decade .
so we have total of 1.5 billion player .
so i started , to go to look what it is , at us these games to what do .
here are the four things that i found . , first one : dringlichkeits-optimismus .
ok , imagine if you like an extreme selbstmotivierung ago .
dringlichkeits-optimismus is the desire , immediately to do something , a challenge to anybody coming , together with the believe that we have a charter for hope to have success .
i believe that a epischer victory is possible , and that it , makes us , it to try , through the same .
players are not sit around .
players are masters in those 27-year-old poet of nets .
there 's a lot more interesting , that can show that we people more like , after we do with you 've been playing , even if you us stop evil defeated correctly .
the reason that is that 's lots of trust , with somebody a game to play .
we rely on that someone time with us to spend that the rules would be honored , that we the same have and to the end by .
so the technologies that we see that grow out of ties , trust and each other .
as a result of them , we build more powerful social relations on .
glückselige productivity . fantastic !
you know , there 's a reason why , the teilzeitjob of warcraft-spieler 22 hours per week , as it as durchschnitts-word .
the reason is that , if we play , we are actually be happier , hard to work , as if we relax , or do nothing .
we know that we as human beings can work , if we make hard , where do .
and players are always ready , hard to work , if you some of the task .
and ultimately , is meaning .
players love it , part of awe planetarer missions gebietender 'd seen .
here a hintergrundinformation , the objects into the light to your back . you know all of wikipedia , the largest set up the world .
the second largest up the world , with another one is the world of warcraft up .
five million people use it every month .
they have more information about world of warcraft , the internet things than about some other issue in each other 's the world .
they 're creating a epic story .
they 're creating a epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , that are so four to that leads to a single result . players are super-mächtige , hopeful individuals .
it are people , the believe that you , as a single change the world can .
and the only problem is that they believe , they can the virtual worlds to change , but not , the real .
this is the problem that i want to solve these attempts .
edward volkswissenschaftler is a castronova .
his work is awesome . he studied well , why people that much time , energy and money in online-welten spend .
and he says , `` we 're going to witness of not less than a online-spielumgebungen in virtual worlds and massenemigration . ''
and that from an economist . so he 's obvious .
and he says ...
not as i am i think of games , i 'm doing something überschwänglich .
so he says , it makes actually make sense , because the player can in online-welten more than in real life .
they can in play more powerful social ties with each other than in real life . they get more feedback and rewards in games than in real life .
so , he says , it 's currently being that players are more time in the virtual world as in the real spend .
i agree that first time to , it makes sense .
but it 's definitely no optimalsituation .
we have to really the real world in a game to turn into .
my daily basis comes from one event , the 2,500 years ago .
there 's these ancient cube , from schafsknöcheln . you know ?
these fantastic just google , there 's schafsknöchel .
and that were , the first of humans evolved spielgeräte .
and if you with the mechanics of the ancient greek historian herodotus 're familiar , you know about maybe this story . the story about how , and why games .
according lydien games , more würfelspiele , in the kingdom herodotus during a famine invented .
supposedly , there 's such a great famine , that the king of lydien to a crazy idea decided that .
the people who suffered none . the people fought side .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
so they invented , according würfelspiel , that herodotus and agreed to a national energy strategy . in one day would you eat . the next day you would play .
and they would just as much in the glückseliger to be asking , games so fascinating and us with now , würfelspiel productivity by that they forget that it 's nothing to eat out there .
and then , the next day you would play . and the next day would you eat .
and according herodotus they survive so for 18 years that famine , by them in one day ate ravenously and the next was playing .
as well , i think , do we use today games .
we put play a way to the suffering from the real world to get away .
we put play a way to all due to think , and that in the real world 's not work , everything that in real life does n't quite gratifying it is , and we get us what we need from the play .
but that does n't been the current .
that 's exciting .
according würfelspiel was 18 years the famine is not better . so i decided to the king , a final herodotus that .
they divided the kingdom in two halves .
they played a würfelspiel and the winner boxes to try to that epic adventure and it .
they left the lydien and on the , looking for a new home . they were just so many people back , how it food to survive there and looking with the rest of an area , when they are able to .
that sounds crazy , right ?
but we lydier show that the etrusker , the later that very rich , the same dna as the old dna-beweise have astonishing .
so we got , scientists recently , and that herodotus crazy story actually true .
and you found evidence for a global cooling , the almost 20 years turned into what that famine in a little could .
so that of these crazy story .
maybe they actually have their people through play rescued by saying , you stand for 18 years in games have escaped and then this just had and so much about that playing with each learned that they determined by the whole civilization have saved .
so , that we can also .
we play since 1994 warcraft .
it was the first warcraft-serie in real the world of strategiespiel . that was 16 years ago .
they played for 18 years würfelspiele , we play has been around 16 years of warcraft .
so what i , we 're ready for our own all play .
so , they sent the half of civilization depended on the , looking for a new world . so i took my 21 billion spielstunden per week .
we should it 's that half of us an hour a day with play out , until we problems of the real world have solved .
i know , they 'll ask , `` how we solve problems of the real world in games ? '' and exactly that question i have my work in the last years at the center for the future to .
we have this banner in our office in palo alto , it 's from how we the future can see why should .
we do n't want to try to the future of money to say .
what we want , is the future to create .
we want to the best possible result imagine . and then these people to empower them , this idea in the reality to prototype .
we imagine be easy wins , and give people the possibilities , to reach them .
i 'll show you very quickly three games that i 've designed together to try , people over here in their own future to give yourself .
this is `` world without oil . ''
this game is of 2007 .
it 's a game , for you a ölknappheit get to .
the nachrichten-filme 's invented , but we have enough online-inhalte , so it for them , it will and you 'll have real life in fact , without oil life . so , when you to play register , you tell us , where you live . and then they ölknappheit , in real show you the , how much oil costs , what 's not there , like food at risk is to transport increased risk is , whether schools , are , whether it is there . and they 're going to figure out of how you very real life , if it would be . and we ask them , about to blog , video or shot photographs to .
we have this game with 1.700 players in 2007 tested . and we have you ever since over the last three years of hysterical .
and i can tell you , it was a new experience .
nobody wants to life change , because it 's good for the environment is or because we do it should .
but if you 're in this epic adventure and said , `` is about us that oil from . ''
this is a fascinating about adventure , on that you go .
they find out , how they were going to . most of our greatest players have the in play have habits and invasive .
so we 've gone for the next ölknappheit play a bigger , higher than the end into than just weltrettende .
we have the game `` superstruct '' at the center for the future .
starting point is that calculation of supercomputers that the people , to 23 years on the planet are left .
this thing called `` global sensibilisierungs-system aussterbungs- , '' of course .
the call to players , wanted to sign , we have almost like a `` -film '' jerry-bruckheimer designed accordingly .
you 're used to ex-sträfling , where it the `` dream-team '' there . they have the astronaut , the scientists , the bruckheimer-filme and just crashed , you can save the world .
but in our ladders game , instead of only five people , we say , everybody 's in dream-team , and it 's our job , the future for energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice to create .
players who played the game at eight weeks .
they found out 500 incredibly creative solutions that you read , if you `` superstruct '' google .
and the last game we bring the 3 . march out . it 's a game in collaboration with the world .
if you the game so , and you come from the world bank account the `` social umgestalter , '' in 2010 .
we 're working with universities in sub-saharan africa and they invite a , social lives to learn .
we have a comic . we have `` level up '' for wissensvernetzung understand , regionales , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
i want to you all you , this game with young people to share , all over the world , especially in entwicklungsgebieten , the benefit from it , fuse together in their own social enterprises to imagine , the world to save .
i come from the end .
i want to you something questions .
what , you think that happens , the next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that us to know what we can do , but we have the real world still not be saved .
well , i 'm hoping that they told me in stories agree that players human resources are , that we need to work in real life can use , and that play a big meaning for change .
we have all these superpowers , epischer productivity , the ability , strong social nets to knit , dringlichkeits-optimismus and that require surgery , glückselige meaning .
i really hope that we actually play games to this , this planet a more to take century to survive .
and i hope that you will with me like play , and play .
if i entered the next decade vorausschaue , i 'm at two things : that we any kind of the future can create , and that we all kinds of play games can .
so i say , let the weltverändernden games start !
thanks .
i 'd like to something to talk about what i 'm going on a few months to write a article for italian wired noticed is .
i have to write my nachgeschlagen our questions , but i was with the kind of the script already done , and i noticed that i still never in my life synonym-wörterbuch , what the word `` a really means .
i read them the post ago .
`` disabled , '' most , `` do , helpless , useless , destroyed , there , of , you , so , geborsten , from nachgebessert , is , stricken , very , there , paralyzed , altersschwach senil , gehandicapt , from the traffic moved , verwahrlost , done , broken lahm , vote , lo and also get hurt , ineffective and weak .
antonyme , healthy , strong , for . ''
i have this list of a friend , according to and had to find laughter , it seemed so ridiculous , but i was just to `` so '' and could n't even more verbundenden , and had to stop to read and i 'm collecting , this wortflut überfallartigen and the so weitersprechen emotional shock .
of course was that a synonym-wörterbuch , an old ausgefranstes . i 've told me just thought that the copy , each one must be .
but actually it was a copy on the early 1980s , when i just with the school actually started and so began , my self just outside of my family enclosures get to build and to form , also in terms of other children and to the world around me .
and god . thank when i do n't synonym-wörterbuch used .
i would this post take seriously , i would in a world born , that someone like me as a person that are able to mean , whose lives in keinster way positive that can . today , but i 'm going to the opportunity and adventure , the i 've experienced , celebrated .
so i just immediately the ansprechenderen of 2009 , to and expect that i here a online-ausgabe we think .
there 's the this version of this eintrags .
about it is n't much better .
especially to shake me the last two words , `` because antonyms '' `` well , '' and `` healthy . ''
but it 's not just with the words .
it 's about , what we think about the people think that we do with these words of tree .
it is the values , the in these words stuck , and how we these values , .
our language affects our thinking and how we the world and the people to see around us .
many ausspricht societies , including the the greek and the roman , have really believed that the way of fluchs a great force has , because that , what to the altertümliche it , they also can manifest .
now , which we want to actually beautiful -- a those people or a powerful people ?
already a human überzustülpen as a child to call , could be enough , you some work and you have performances achtlos .
it would n't beautiful , you doors to open up ?
a human beings , for me the has opened , was my pediatrician in the delaware . by the institute in wilmington in a.i .
he is dr. italo-amerikaner . a pizzutillo , whose name , as you think , to the most americans do n't know it could . so , he was always dr. c.p .
and dr. ; she was always very good flying and was for the work with kids just like water .
i found the time that i do in this hospital i have spent , just great -- until on my physiotherapie .
i had one to be exercises , it infinitely often do with these big fat , bein-muskeln bändern -- in different colors -- that you know how to my elastischen build . and i have this on more being vilified as everything else . i realize they hated . i did you know . i 've they hated it .
and you imagine , supposing i whistled even when natürllich kid with dr. p. negotiate and so , up to these exercise to stop , fünfjähriges with no success .
and one day , he has taught me , of my exercise their learning -- these exercise it was , and -- -- and he said to me , `` wow , who , you 've been so a strong , powerful and young girl , you 're going one day of trying to whatsoever .
and if you get it says , i give you a hundred dollars . ''
course that was just a simple trick of dr. p. so that i the exercise will do that i do n't really wanted to do , with the prospect that on the girl in the ward in the second third floor . but it has led me in fact , my daily vielversprechendes with new eyes to see . so that spawned a new and übungs-horror experience .
and i wonder now , how very his vision of me as strong and powerful tool that young girl with my self being formed and i feel like i could never imagine , me as a part-time nature , strong , powerful and atlethischen person to see .
that 's just a example of many , like adults in machtpositionen the comprehension of a child for stimulation .
but how the been quoted examples from the synonym-wörterbüchern prove that makes us our language is no room , which means something to figure out what we all wish : it every single to really , singing as powerful people to see .
our language is the social changes as no , the in many cases through a technology changes it .
the medical contribution from beginning of course you say that my legs , the networking for kniegelenke , sehbehinderungen of titanium dioxide and lesions that they for its own body , that it 'll allow people , really all their opportunities to use and women , the borders that you your natural destiny with trying to figure out to develop , do n't need to speak of social laser-chirurgie platforms , to people did a own identity , there , you want own way and way it is that , and come with the beginning to groups are , the , you choose .
maybe that so this technological change and clear because the that it 's always been a different truth gave , which is that every single person of society 's something very besonderess and very powerful tool that there can and that the human ability to adapt , our biggest plus is .
the human ability to -- that 's an interesting story , because people me again and that he would ask them to tell me , what i do with whom ? and i 'm going to you something to confess , this particular sentence for me never gepasst and i was always very uncomfortable with it felt , the questions of these people to to answer , and i think , gradually i can understand , why .
that sentence by the things that you with against tremendous family lives of the idea that success or happiness on it , a challenge to anybody coming , without any of the so on top experience a cautionary note . as if my life so successful that would , because i the kinds of falling of a life with a prosthetic it was able to , but , people me with my disability as well .
but the truth is that we change . course , we are from the challenge that , no matter whether you physically , emotionally , or even the two is
and what i 'm aware that is good .
there are not an obstacle that we umkurven to chuck out with our lives better clear to come .
there are just to our lives .
and i tend to think that such as my shadow , to see .
sometimes i realize that he 's very your mind is , sometimes is he 's hard to see , but he 's constantly struggled with me .
and i want to do n't , the impact , or sterility . the the kampfs of people have .
there 's in life be adversities , and challenges , and the are just alllzu real and each person is so slightly differently . but the question is not , whether we had clear to confront or not , but how we 've seen it 's coming .
so we 're not just responsible for , the people that we love , ago schicksalsschlägen to preserve them , but they also to prepare , well with it clear to come .
and we 're going to our kids do n't have fallen , if we give you feel that give that they do n't want to this .
you have to two things became clear to separate : one thing , the medical fact , had to be and to another that 's something about this , if i was a 'm or not .
and now , to be , the only real and we disability , with the i told me apart had , is that the world and says , they could do to me with these kinds of tree .
in our desire , the people to protect , the us at the heart and you the cold , the truth about their medical prediction to report or even a forecast the quality to imagine that you are expected , we have to that we do n't really made for a time , that somebody actually a result is .
maybe this is this concept , that that just paying attention , what 's in a broken is , and how we fix , for every single one more profound disability than the pathology labs .
if we have a people not a treat , and not all its forces and opportunity to perceive and acknowledge , we do it in addition to the natural struggle , where you may lead to , one another disease .
we degradieren a human beings , for our society a value .
so we have about the patologie look out and us on all of the human possibilities to focus .
the most important , but this is that 's between the perception of pushing and our college completion of ingenuity , a connection there .
we should these difficult times does n't stop or us , we should n't try , you to avoid , we should they 're under the carpet return , but it 's about , in the defender retaliates against tremendous opportunity to recognize .
it gets me about perhaps more , is clear to imagine that we had n't necessarily have to , but that we 're for quite frankly , you to hug , and make it like to put to also a sponge kampf-ausdruck to use and maybe even with it to dance .
and maybe we do it , such as something natural , coherent and useful to see and we are so through their presence , is not so learn tools .
this year , and we 're 200 of the birthday of charles darwin and when he was 150 years ago about evolution has written , did darwin , in my eyes , on something very true in the human nature of warfare .
i would it this is : not the most of this species survives , and also not the intelligenteste of itself , but the , a change the best to participate .
of conflicts of creativity .
not only from darwin 's work , we know that the ability of people , to survive and actually , from the fight the human mind is of water , conflict to turn this .
so , again , by adapting and are the great skills of the people .
and maybe we know , for some timber which we ball are , if we really to be .
maybe this is that 's exactly the point of adversities , a perception of these eyes , a sense of our own power .
we can be so even something to .
we can be adversities , a new meaning to give , the over time goes out .
maybe we can be adversities , as a change see .
there are for a change , of the we still do n't have adapted .
i think , to make the most of damage the , we even done to have , is to believe that we 're normal to be .
, -- who is normal ?
it is not normal .
there 's the usual . to that . but not the normal . and they would those poor , this person 's really know to learn when it they really convinced that ?
i think , not .
it would be great , if we have this paradigm of the piles up against a different kind of the ways , or the strength , to make it even still a little bit dangerous to me , they could . so we can the forces of very many kids who release , and they invite you , your very special and those skills in the society in .
anthropolgen have found that we humans from the members of our society , from one of being have , useful to be and a contribution to do .
there 's cues on that already the neanderthals , 60,000 years older people and people with the heavy in injuries related to have worn dozens and this was perhaps , because the wisdom in sort of these people for the society that was ,
they have these people not as a broken and how about it ; they were as something special and those things , treated .
a few years , i went in the city , when i grew up was , in a scheffel in the `` the zone '' in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i was there in front of lebensmittelmarkt this .
it was earlier , and i had shorts .
and i hear , like a guy behind me , `` well if that 's not who is . ''
and i turn , me to and see this whether her husband . i had no idea who he is .
and i meant `` sorry , sir , we know us ? i ca n't know , you remember . ''
and he said , `` well , you may remember me .
when i want you the first time saw that , i want them out of the belly of her mother to . ''
oh , so the .
and of course , it has but then they were done .
that was , dr. kean , a man , who i just out of narratives of my mother about this day know , because i course , quite typical , to my birthday , two weeks to be late .
the doctor for just diagnostics of my mom was in on holiday , and so i knew my parents of the man , the me to the world , all .
and because i do without überbringer was born , and my feet , after them pointing and i just a few toes , at that and a few toes at the other foot had he was the wadenbeine , of these strangers to the bad news right .
he said to me , `` i had to your parents say that you should never going to , and never been so , inside be would like other children or that you 'll never been a completely independent life could talk , and since they 've got me simply lying well . ''
really exceptional , i found that he hershey my entire childhood of practice has , whatever , whether i held in hahnemann in the second grade , whether i do with the medizin-studenten in the mermaid parade itself to errungen the was , whatever , if i was my transplant fellowship , or of my colleague has halloween had , and he was using these clips to his students to teach , pfadfindern from the buchstabier-wettbewerb medical school and the zeitungsausschnitte medical school .
and he called this part of his kurses the x factor , potential of the human i .
you can just not enough to point , how critical of factor for the quality of people might be .
and dr. kean she goes on , he said , `` i 've learned that kids , if you do n't always something else said , and also if you just a little support to get to having children , to show to do , it can children are very much . ''
you see , dr. kean has to be thinking changed .
he had understood that the medical diagnosis , and how someone to deal , two different things are .
and also i blew my thinking over the changed over time , if you me the age of 15 years are they were saying , whether i mean who against your legs of meat and bone , would have , then i would have no one second a .
i want to look at once have normal .
if you me that today questions , i 'm not so sure .
and that 's happening , because i do something with my legs 've experienced and not in spite of these experiences .
and perhaps could this change also happen , because i was so many people in am , the door opened , instead of people to face , the me this or me an idea on wanted .
you see , it takes really just a human beings , you demos , as you to the fundamental forces of manifest can , and they 're going through .
if you do it 's the place , his own , and forces to activate , -- the human mind is so empfangsbereit -- if they do that , and for anyone in a critical moment a door busts open , then you 're for those people a very good teachers .
they bring them in itself , doors to open .
the real importance of the word `` educe '' is rooted in the word `` educate . ''
it means , something to that in one is , the potential herauszukitzeln .
again , what the potential we want , then , it ?
in the 1960s years was in britain 's a gesamtschulen done . at gymnasien in fallstudie transformed .
they call that there , `` they trials '' in the u.s. we call this as `` design . ''
the students to be , we is .
and the a student will mündlich harder to , get the better teacher , etc .
they have then over a three period of students with a `` damn science '' the top grade , `` very good '' gave them . it was told them , they were asse that you , very clever would be . and after these three months have you really been written .
and of course ; it 's a the heart to hear that the the einser-schülern been said , they were just a good enough .
and as it was then after the three months , too .
but only those that , still in school , were -- apart from the students , the school at the dean 's had .
so very crucial in this trial was that the teachers wo n't eingeweiht were .
the teachers wo n't know that something changed .
you it was just told that 's face the student and that are the students with the kind enough . and as you have you something about teaching and turn them .
the only really at disability is a 's mind a spirit , the broken , who has no hope . he find nothing more beautiful . he is sort of our natural , into one of curiosity . and our innate capacity for the imagination .
if we do it but , create the human spirit to support , continue to hope for themselves , and other people to them . around to find , curious , and phantasievoll to be then we put our forces really positive .
if a spirit of those qualities that , we can be a new reality and new daseinsformen create .
i want to a poem by saying that draws from one on poet named dembois in the 20th century , it was and of me my friend of hafiz tells you have . and the poem called `` the god , the only four words knows . '' `` every child knows god , not the god the names , not the god the history , but the god , the only four words that 's better and these are repeated , he says , only : come , dance with me . ''
come , dance with me . thank you .
